These results establish the twisted double bilayer graphene as easily tunable platform for exploring new paradigm of quantum many-body states. [10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17] Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with a small twist angle θ possesses significantly reconstructed band structure. 1,2,3 In vicinity of a magic angle (MA), i.e. <quantifiedObject id="d62d0efe-3845-4762-af4d-289e256a8361">θ</quantifiedObject>≈<measure type="value" ptr="#d62d0efe-3845-4762-af4d-289e256a8361">1.1°</measure>, strong interlayer hybridization leads to a flat band formation with low energy and narrow bandwidth, greatly enhances the electronic interaction effect 1,4,5,6 than those of graphene or bilayer graphene without twisting. 7 So far, correlated insulating states and superconductivity have been observed for a variety of partially filled bands, 4,5,6 suggesting the TBG systems acquire novel features resembling strange metal in highTc superconductivity, <measure type="value" ptr="#9f1ed7f6-9c21-4770-b2f4-48ce97e29350">5,10 </measure><quantifiedObject id="9f1ed7f6-9c21-4770-b2f4-48ce97e29350">novel states </quantifiedObject>of the Mott insulator, 4,11-15 unconventional and topological superconductor, 5,<measure type="list">16,17 (fragile) topological band structure, 18,19 quantum anomalous Hall effect 11,20 </measure>and many others, consequently spur the interests of theoretical and experimental communities alike. However, to observe these interesting correlation induced phenomena, one has to control θ accurately enough in TBG, which puts strict constraint in device fabrications. Therefore, easier access to the flat band by alternative approaches is of high importance. Recently, Mott insulator and superconductivity have been observed in TBG with <quantifiedObject id="4ba1db43-12ba-4d61-9ad5-6f9dfdeb39cf">θ</quantifiedObject>&gt;<measure type="interval" ptr="#4ba1db43-12ba-4d61-9ad5-6f9dfdeb39cf">1.1</measure>° by exerting an external high pressure. 6 Another approach is to apply vertical displacement electrical fields, achieved in ABC-stacked trilayer graphene on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). 21,22 However, tuning by displacement field fails in TBG, possibly due to strong interlayer hybridization. 3,6 Twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG), on the other hand, is more likely to possess a flat band and display correlated phenomena. 23 It is known that monolayer graphene possesses linearly dispersive energy bands, showing no dependence on the displacement electrical fields. In contrast, AB stacked bilayer graphene shows parabolic band dispersion and gap opening at charge neutral point (CNP) could be induced under displacement electrical fields. 7,8,9 The gap reaches its minimum not rightly at, but close to K point, displaying a "Mexican-hat" dispersion of band structure. 7,9 Such a dispersion hosts a narrower band width and could enable flat band formation in TDBG by displacement fields.</p><p>In this work, we report the success in easy tunability in TDBG by vertical electrical fields. At specific range of electric fields, we observe correlated Mott-like insulating state corresponding to the half-filled band on the electron branch, and more importantly, signatures of superconductivity with <quantifiedObject id="ddf6b0e4-10a2-4893-a105-824f5e92bfd1">Tc onset </quantifiedObject>at ~12 K and <measure type="value" ptr="#ddf6b0e4-10a2-4893-a105-824f5e92bfd1">50%</measure></p><p>resistance Tc at ~7 K in the vicinity of the Mott insulator. Our devices have the unique advantages that the characteristic temperature scales of Mott insulator and superconductivity are above the liquid helium temperature, therefore greatly reduced the requirement in device fabrications and sample characterizations. Moreover, under parallel magnetic fields, we found Mott gap for the <measure type="value">half</measure>-filled band become stronger, suggesting a spin-polarized ordering and the correspondingly unconventional pairing mechanism of superconductivity.</p><p>TDBG samples were fabricated following a typical "tear and stack" technique 24 with <quantifiedObject id="4e1d213f-f508-41d4-b5c5-62cefe79026f">θ accuracy </quantifiedObject>at <measure type="value" ptr="#4e1d213f-f508-41d4-b5c5-62cefe79026f">~0.1°</measure>. One-dimensional edge contact 25 was applied with a good characteristic less than <measure type="interval">1 kΩ·um</measure>. Figure 1a shows the schematic structure of our devices. Under proper displacement electrical fields, the reformed band structure of AB stacked bilayer graphene, hosts more flatness in the top of valence band and bottom of conduction band, and thus facilitate the formation of flat band in TDBG (Fig. 1b). All the devices are first picked out through their "U" shaped G-Vg curves at room temperature，which show greatly decreased carrier mobility because of the presence of flat band. .</p><p>We firstly tested <measure type="value">two </measure>dual-gate devices with <quantifiedObject id="25af7930-19e6-4c39-9c33-f40ff4cef9bb">θ</quantifiedObject>=<measure type="value" ptr="#25af7930-19e6-4c39-9c33-f40ff4cef9bb">1.28° </measure>(device-1) and <quantifiedObject id="fae49128-861c-431f-8b3d-2117d6dad301">θ</quantifiedObject>=<measure type="value" ptr="#fae49128-861c-431f-8b3d-2117d6dad301">1.31° </measure>(device-2) to reveal the transport behavior of the <measure type="value">half</measure>-filled insulating states in TDBG.</p><p>Both devices show single-particle superlattice gap at n=±ns at electron and hole branch (Fig. 1c, 1d) (we note higher-order superlattice gaps at n=±3ns are observed in device-3 with a smaller <quantifiedObject id="5f0e1001-4a83-480c-a821-9ff3142d63b9">θ </quantifiedObject>around <measure type="value" ptr="#5f0e1001-4a83-480c-a821-9ff3142d63b9">1.0°</measure>). The twist angle can be calculated through We can see an obvious insulating state at n=ns/2 at electron branch under an intermediate D (Fig. 1c). Fitting through Arrhenius formula ~∆ 2 , the correlated gap in device-2 is estimated to be around 1meV, modified by displacement fields (Fig. 1d, inset) (We also note that the gap at <measure type="value">half</measure>-filling varies with twist angle and device quality). Landau levels (LLs) of filling factor v=<measure type="value">2</measure>, <measure type="list">4 and 6</measure>, emanating from half-filled Mott states. The <measure type="value">two-fold </measure>degeneracy of LLs, suggests only <measure type="value">one </measure>preserved degeneracy while others are lifted for the upper Hubbard band, possibly due to ferromagnetic spin arrangement in the Mott insulator (will be discussed later).

Figure 3a shows a representative R-T curve. At a low temperature &lt;4K the system develops zero resistance. The estimated Tc for 50% <quantifiedObject id="16ba8ed5-e1d5-4b18-852b-88f8a1dfeb43">normal state resistance </quantifiedObject>is about <measure type="value">7K</measure>, and Tc onset is about at <measure type="value">12K</measure>. Such high Tc in TDBG is above the liquid helium temperature and also much higher than the temperature scale of Tc in MA-TBG 5,6 and ABC stacked trilayer graphene, <measure type="value">22 </measure>this discovery certainly bestows one with confidence and points out direction to achieve even higher Tc in future experiments. Figure 3b shows only <measure type="value">one </measure>superconductivity pocket, located at electron side of halffilled insulator. The pocket shrinks with the increased temperature. Note that fluctuations around <measure type="value">zero </measure>resistance possibly arises from inhomogeneous distribution of twist angle in our devices, which is also hosted in previous work. 6 The inhomogeneity leads to the co-existence of insulator and superconductivity and finally forms stray capacitance which causes fluctuation of AC current phase during our measurements. Similar to the electrically tunable Mott insulator, superconductivity in TDBG can also be mediated by displacement fields, as depicted in Figure 3c. As we sweep the top gate voltage while keeping a constant back gate voltage varied from -16V to -31V, the <measure type="value">zero </measure>resistance pocket shrinks and finally disappears. Thus a <measure type="value">zero </measure>resistance behavior modulated by carrier density as well as displacement fields is present in TDBG.</p><p>Finally, we discuss the electronic nature of the <measure type="value">half</measure>-filled Mott insulator and superconductivity in its vicinity. Since perpendicular fields affect not only spin but also orbital dynamics, to isolate the mechanism related with these correlated states, we instead exerted parallel magnetic fields in device-3 (graphite acts as back-gate) with <quantifiedObject id="907b0697-30e0-46d4-82ae-a386744e85d8">θ</quantifiedObject>=<measure type="value" ptr="#907b0697-30e0-46d4-82ae-a386744e85d8">1.06° </measure>and probe the field dependence in resistances. Fig. 4a shows absence of half-filled insulating state at B//=<measure type="value">0T </measure>(Fig. 4a). The parallel magnetic fields monotonously enhance resistance at n=ns/2 (Fig. 4c) and lead to an obvious insulating state at moderate D and higher B// (Fig. 4b, <measure type="value">4c</measure>). Since B// only affects spin degree of freedom, the enhanced insulating behavior implies the insulating state at ns/2 is likely to be spin-polarized. Arising from Zeeman effect, magnetic fields induces gap Δ=gμBB//, between spin-up and spin-down electrons, where the g factor for electrons in graphene is ~2 and μB is the Bohr magneton. From the Arrhenius formula of resistance, we obtain thermal activated gap as a function of B//, which shows nearly linear increase as shown in Fig.4d. Thus we deduce the effective g factor is about <measure type="value">2.12</measure>, coincident with the expectation, and more importantly reveal the fact that the Mott gap is more likely to be spin-triplet gap, very different from the spin-singlet gap in the TBG system. 4,6</p><p>Although in many cases Mott insulators are likely to be associated with the antiferromagnetic ordering. However, ferromagnetism can also be present in Mott insulators such as Ba2NaOsO6 31 and Lu2V2O7. 32 Considering that the superconductivity occurs in the vicinity of the <measure type="value" ptr="#814090eb-518a-418b-b20d-1ec42bc30f02">half</measure>-<quantifiedObject id="814090eb-518a-418b-b20d-1ec42bc30f02">filled spin-polarized </quantifiedObject>Mott-like state, a bold conjecture of ferromagnetic fluctuations mediated superconductivity in TDBG could be put forward. Such a case has been found in UGe2, where the superconductivity phase coexists with itinerant-electron ferromagnetic phase <measure type="value">33 </measure>.

The fabrication of metal top gate and electrodes follows a standard e-beam lithography and e-beam metal evaporation. Devices were designed as Hall bar structure and shaped by traditional reactive ion etching with CHF3 and O2 mixture gas. Here, the metal top gate also acts as a mask for etching to ensure the channel is fully gated. Finally, all the bars were contacted through one-dimensional edge contact with Cr/Au electrodes.</p></text>
