We reported bulk superconductivity up to <measure type="value"><num>7.6 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>through careful manipulation of the charge carrier density and interlayer spacing d in the chemically intercalated <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>dimensional 1T-SnSe2 phase. We found, for the first time in the <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>dimensional SnSe2, that polar organic molecules cointercalated with the alkali metal Li into the basal layers, thus significantly enhancing the superconducting Tc. We observed that the Tc scales with the basal spacing distance, meanwhile being almost independent of x in Lix(THF)ySnSe2 system. Our results offers a new general chemical route to study the rich electron correlations and the interplay of charge density wave and unconventional superconductivity in the <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>dimensional material.</p><p><measure type="value"><num>Two </num></measure>dimensional layered materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have attracted significant research interests in the past decade due to their fantastic physical properties such as layer-dependent band gap [1][2][3], topology [4][5][6][7][8][9], and valley-related transport induced by broken inversion symmetry [10][11][12][13][14]. Great progress has been made in the fundamental and nanoscale device studies of these materials towards their potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, and spintronics [15][16][17][18]. The layered feature of these TMDs permits a variety of guest atoms, molecules or electrons to be intercalated into the van der Waals gap of the host materials. Numerous works have reported on the drastic change to the optical and electrical properties of layered materials when they are subjected to intercalation into the van der Waals gaps with group I or II alkali metal atoms or inorganic molecules [19][20][21][22][23][24][25]. Superconductivity has been induced in many of these TMD materials through both chemical doping/intercalation [26][27][28][29][30][31] and physical gating methods [32][33][34][35][36], with the very recent highlight of gate-induced superconductivity in the topological WTe2 system [37,38].</p><p>Comparatively, much fewer efforts have been made in the study of post-transition metal dichalcogenides, which have different electronic structures from TMDs owing to their lack of d-electron contributions to bands near the Fermi surface [39,40]. Tin-based dichalcogenides, for example, crystallized solely in the <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>dimensional CdI2-type 1T phase to date [41], similar as MoS2, where hexagonal closely packed sandwich * These authors contributed equally to this work † To whom correspondence should be addressed: blv@utdallas.edu layers are stacked with a periodicity of <measure type="value"><num>one </num></measure>layer tin atom and <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>layers chalcogenide atoms forming tilted SnSe6 octahedra. The interlayer spaces of ~ <measure type="value"><num>5.785 </num><measure type="?" unit="Å">Å </measure></measure>for SnS2 and <measure type="list"><num>6.137 </num><measure type="?" unit="Å">Å </measure></measure>for SnSe2 that are loosely bonded by van der Waals forces. Compared to MoS2, the larger interlayer spacing in the Sn dichalchogenide materials will result in a higher possible degree of chemical species intercalations as well as provide a buffer for the large volume change associated with the intercalation processes. In fact, superconductivity has been reported through the intercalation of organic metallocenes with possible charge density wave (CDW) interplay at higher temperatures, another signature for unconventional superconductivity [42][43][44]. Gating techniques have induced superconductivity at <measure type="value"><num>3.9 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>with the in plane upper critical field greatly exceed the Pauli limit [45]. In addition, interface superconductivity is suggested in a SnSe2/graphite heterostructure through STM study [46,47]. The unexpected large superconducting gap bears a number of similarities to that of cuprates, providing additional strong evidence for unconventional superconductivity. In addition, SnSe2 and SnS2, are also widely used for solar cells [48], anode of lithium/sodium ion batteries [49,50], field effect transistors [51] and also photodetector [52].</p><p>Herein, we report bulk superconductivity up to <measure type="value"><num>7.6 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>in the alkali metal Li-intercalated LixSnSe2 and the organic molecule cointercalated LixMySnSe2, where M is tetrahydrofuran (THF) or propylene carbonate (PC). We have systematically investigated the controllability of both carrier density x, organic molecules M, and the interlayer spacing d. While an interesting x-independent superconducting transition temperature is preserved, a significant Tc enhancement of up to <measure type="interval"><num atMost="100">100</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>, depending on the interlayered spacing, was observed by organic molecule cointercalation. Finally, detailed transport studies suggest the presence of unconventional superconductivity in this cointercalated SnSe2 system.</p><p>The SnSe2 crystals was synthesized as follows. the mixture of high purity tin ingot (Alfa Aesar, <measure type="value"><num>99.99</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>) and selenium pieces (Alfa Aesar, <measure type="value"><num>99.999</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>),were sealed in a evacuate quartz tube heated to <measure type="interval"><num atMost="950">950 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C </measure></measure>in <measure type="value"><num>20 </num><measure type="TIME" unit="hours">hours </measure></measure>for <measure type="value"><num>24 </num><measure type="TIME" unit="hours">hours</measure></measure>, and then slowly cooled down to <measure type="interval"><num atMost="650">650 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C </measure></measure>to obtain high purity SnSe2 precursor. The high quality SnSe2 single crystals are grown through vertical Bridgeman method using the pre-reacted SnSe2 powder in the doubled sealed quartz tube container, with growth zone at <measure type="value"><num>950 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C</measure></measure>, cooling zone at <measure type="value"><num>500 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C</measure></measure>, moving rate at <measure type="value"><num>1.5 </num><measure type="?" unit="mm/h">mm/h </measure></measure>and total growth time of <measure type="value"><num>20 </num><measure type="TIME" unit="days">days</measure></measure>. The grounded powder of SnSe2 crystals grown from Bridgeman method was used as starting material for our intercalation studies.</p><p>Since the Li-intercalated samples are air sensitive, all the intercalation and co-intercalation process were performed inside purified Ar-atmosphere glovebox with total O2 and H2O levels &lt; <measure type="interval"><num atMost="0.1">0.1 </num><measure type="CONCENTRATION" unit="ppm">ppm</measure></measure>. The n-butyllithium (n-BuLi) used was 2. The powder samples were dried, and cold pressed into pellets under uniaxial stress for the following physical measurements. X-ray diffraction patterns were collected using the Rigaku Smartlab. Electrical resistivity ρ was measured by employing a standard 4-probe method down to <measure type="value"><num>1.8 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>in a Quantum Design Physical Property Measurement System (PPMS). The magnetization was carried out using the Quantum Design Magnetic Property Measurement System (MPMS).</p><p>Because of its <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>dimensional layered nature, SnSe2 thin flakes obtained from grinding the Bridgman-grown crystals have very strong c-axis preferred orientation in their X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns. The strongest (001) peak, therefore, is used to compare and determine the lattice expansion during the intercalation process. In Figure 1 we shown the XRD patterns for both the intercalated samples and the parent compound. The use of different organic solvents can severely impact the intercalation process. The polar organic molecules such as THF and PC, with their stronger reducing power due to the cation-dipole interaction, can cointercalate with the cations, but non-polar solvent molecules such as hexane used in n-BuLi reaction are not cointercalated. As seen in Figure 1a-b, in the n-BuLi/hexane process from method (i), Li atoms are solely intercalated into the interlayer space. Due to the small size and relatively small doping levels of Li ions, we observe only a small lattice shift (~ <measure type="value"><num>0.1</num><measure type="ANGLE" unit="°">°</measure></measure>) with only Li intercalation. Such shift indicates c lattice parameters expands very slightly from <measure type="value"><num>6.137 </num><measure type="?" unit="Å">Å </measure></measure>in parent SnSe2 to <measure type="value"><num>6.180 </num><measure type="?" unit="Å">Å </measure></measure>in the intercalated Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>SnSe2.</p><p>On the other hand, as seen in Figure 1c-d, the lattice parameter c expands dramatically with the presence of cointercalated organic THF and PC molecules synthesized following processes (ii) and (iii). The basal spacing of the compound has been increased from <measure type="value"><num>6.137 </num><measure type="?" unit="Å">Å </measure></measure>from SnSe2, to <measure type="value"><num>10.341 </num><measure type="?" unit="Å">Å </measure></measure>in the Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(THF)ySnSe2 compound. There is some small amount (&lt; <measure type="interval"><num atMost="10">10</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">%</measure></measure>) of SnSe2 that remains unreacted during the intercalation which does not reduce with longer intercalation times nor slightly elevated reaction temperatures (e.g. using a hot plate). For the Lix(PC)ySnSe2 sample, the basal spacing is further increased to <measure type="value"><num>12.081 </num><measure type="?" unit="Å">Å </measure></measure>due to the stronger cation-dipole interaction of PC comparing to THF (dipole moment is <measure type="value"><num>4.94 </num><measure type="?" unit="D">D </measure></measure>for PC, and <measure type="list"><num>1.63 </num></measure>D for THF, 1D= <measure type="value"><num>3.3356 x 10 -30 </num></measure>Cm) [53]. However, this cointercalation process is quite inefficient, with large amount of LixSnSe2 from n-BuLi/hexane left, shown in Figure 1d. The peak at <measure type="value"><num>11.4</num><measure type="ANGLE" unit="°">°</measure></measure>, corresponding to a <measure type="value"><num>7.79 </num><measure type="?" unit="Å">Å </measure></measure>basal spacing, suggests that a possible different intercalation stage, i.e phase separation, exists in the particular sample.</p><p>Magnetic susceptibility data for of Li and cointercalated SnSe2 samples, where all <measure type="value"><num>three </num></measure>samples show diamagnetic signals; (b) Normalized temperature dependent resistivity data. The inset of (a) is the MH loop of Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(THF)ySnSe2 at <measure type="value"><num>2 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K</measure></measure>, and inset of (b) is the enlarged resistivity data highlighting superconducting transition at low temperature from 2 -10 K.</p><p>The cointercalation of organic THF and PC molecules is further evidenced by Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) measurements (see supplemental materials). Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(THF)ySnSe2 starts to decompose at ~ <measure type="value"><num>50 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C </measure></measure>through the loss of THF and Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(PC)ySnSe2 begins decomposition at <measure type="value"><num>80</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="°C">°C</measure></measure>; in both cases these reactions are endothermic in nature. However, given the presence of unreacted SnSe2, LixSnSe2, and the additional issue of possible phase separation, it is rather difficult to determine the precise amount of organic species in the cointercalated samples.</p><p>The dc magnetization of intercalated Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>SnSe2, Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(THF)ySnSe2, and Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(PC)ySnSe2 are shown in the Figure 2a. We can see a clear enhancement of the transition temperature as the basal spacing is increased after intercalation/cointercalation processes. In the Li0.2SnSe2 sample, a small diamagnetic shift emerges from ~ 4 K under <measure type="value"><num>zero </num></measure>field cool (ZFC) with a very small shielding fraction, suggesting the presence of non-bulk superconductivity in the sample. In contrast, for Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(THF)ySnSe2, a much large diamagnetic signal from <measure type="value"><num>7 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>is observed. In addition, the M-H curve, shown in Figure 2a, suggests that type-II superconductivity is present in this sample. As previously noted, the Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(PC)ySnSe2 sample exhibits a further increased basal spacing. Further buttressing the relationship between basal spacing and Tc, we note a concomitant increase in the superconducting transition temperature in Li0.2(PC)ySnSe2, with a further enhancement to <measure type="value"><num>7.6 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K</measure></measure>. However, in the Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(PC)ySnSe2 sample, both <measure type="value"><num>zero </num></measure>field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) data show an additional field expulsion below <measure type="interval"><num atMost="4">4 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K</measure></measure>, which could be caused by LixSnSe2 or phase separation caused by another stage of intercalation.</p><p>The superconducting behavior in these samples can be further verified by the resistivity measurement shown in the Figure 2b. The resistivity measurements confirm the superconducting temperatures of <measure type="value"><num>4.5 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>and 7 K for Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>SnSe2 and Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(THF)ySnSe2, respectively, consistent with the magnetic measurements. For Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>SnSe2, only a <measure type="value"><num>50</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">% </measure></measure>resistivity drop is observed, supporting the hypothesis of non-bulk superconductivity in the sample. For Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(THF)ySnSe2, the superconducting transition is quite sharp and the resistivity reaches to <measure type="value"><num>zero at 6.4 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>with a transition width &lt;<measure type="interval"><num atMost="0.6">0.6 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K</measure></measure>. The Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(PC)ySnSe2 sample is very difficult to compress as a small pellet after intercalation. Therefore, no resistivity measurement is attempted for this sample. It is worthwhile to mention that a clear hump in the (T) curve is present at ~ 100 K for Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(THF)ySnSe2, reminiscent to previous investigations of metallocene-intercalated SnSe2 [44,54]. Similar as the other TMDs such as NbSe2, this hump might associate with the charge density wave (CDW) transition, as a result of <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>dimensional Fermi surface nesting. Because the Li content, i.e. charge carrier changes, is the same for the Li0.2SnSe2 and Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(THF)ySnSe2 samples, this suggests that CDW, rather than charge carrier density, may play an important role for the occurrence of bulk superconductivity, and enhanced Tc comparing with the gating technique.</p><p>Due to the presence of non-bulk superconductivity in LixSnSe2 and the second transition noted in the Lix(PC)ySnSe2 samples, we focused our studies of the carrier change effects on the Lix(THF)ySnSe2 sample. The amount of lithium uptake by SnSe2 could be controlled by changing the amount of Naph.-Li used. Indeed, the ICP-MS measurement has shown we obtained different x=<measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.01">0.01 </num>-<num atMost="0.30">0.30 </num></measure>samples through this method. On the other hand, no significant basal spacing increase is observed from the XRD patterns, indicating the amount of THF uptake is nearly the same for all these Lix(THF)ySnSe2 samples with different Li content since the THF is abundant as the solvent. We show the temperature dependent resistivity data on these samples in Figure 3a. SnSe2 is semiconducting with an indirect band gap <measure type="value"><num>1.07 </num><measure type="?" unit="eV">eV </measure></measure>[40]. As the Li doping increases, the progressive suppression of the insulting behavior can be clearly seen. A slight resistivity drop is observed for x = <measure type="value"><num>0.03 </num></measure>even though the overall bulk material is still insulating, suggesting the emergence of superconductivity at this composition. Upon further Li doping, the magnitude of the superconducting We observed a monotonic increase in Tc with basal spacing, in the Figure 4a. However, this trend does not completely rule out the possibility of a dome-like Tc vs basal spacing behavior upon further intercalation, as seen in the intercalated ZrNCl system [55]. The second trend is that Tc is independent of Li concentration for x &gt; <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.03">0.03</num></measure>, shown in the Figure 4b. This behavior is very similar to the intercalated ZrNCl/HfNCl system where it was attributed to the x-independent N(0) characteristics of a nearly-free electron <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>dimensional system [56][57][58][59]. Charge fluctuations associated with the CDW transiton might therefore play an important role to induce superconductivity in these intercalated systems. In Figure 5 we show the field dependent resistivity data of Li<measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>(THF)ySnSe2. The noise near room temperature is likely associated with the condensation of moisture in the samples, since the sample is very air sensitive. The small upturn in (T)</p><p>Upon the application of the magnetic field, the superconducting transition is both suppressed and broadened, as expected. However, when we plot the upper critical field Hc2 as a function of temperature ( Figure 5) we note a very steep increase in the value of Hc2 with temperature. Using a simple linear extrapolation, the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure>-temperature upper critical field, μ0Hc2(0), is estimated to be 9 T. In contrast, if we apply the WerhmerHelfand-Hohenberge (WHH) model where only the orbital effect is taken into account, the estimated μ0Hc2 (0) Specific heat data were performed to get further insight of the superconductivity. Unfortunately we did not observe any clear superconducting transition at <measure type="value"><num>7 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>for <measure type="value"><num>zero </num></measure>field data. By subtracting the data of <measure type="value"><num>zero </num></measure>field to that of high magnetic field, we can only see a very tiny specific jump. We compared the specific data of parent compound and the superconducting sample, shown in the Fig. 5. By Debye fitting of the data using C = <measure type="value"><num>γNT + βT 3 </num></measure>, we can get γN ~ 0 and β = <measure type="value"><num>1.016 </num><measure type="?" unit="mJ/mol">mJ/mol </measure></measure>K 4 and γN = <measure type="value"><num>0.654 </num><measure type="?" unit="mJ/mol">mJ/mol </measure></measure>K 2 and β = <measure type="value"><num>1.228 </num><measure type="?" unit="mJ/mol">mJ/mol </measure></measure>K 4 , which corresponds to the electronic Sommerfeld coefficient and Debye temperature, for parent and superconducting samples respectively. The Debye temperature can be derived from the β value through the relationship θD = (12π 4 kBNAZ/5β) 1/3 , where NA is the Avogadro constant, and Z is the number of atoms in the molecule. The calculated Debye temperature is <measure type="value"><num>180 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>and <measure type="list"><num>166 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>for parent and superconducting compounds respectively.</p><p>As the Sommerfeld coefficient corresponding to the density of states at Fermi level, with γN ~ 0 corresponding to the insulating properties of the parent compound.
