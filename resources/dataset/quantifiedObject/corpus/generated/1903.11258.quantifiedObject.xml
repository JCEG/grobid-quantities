The former may be a platform of topological superconductivity, <measure type="list">41,45,46</measure>,48) and the latter is parity-violating electromagnetic order. Experimental study traces back to magnetic monopole order in Cr 2 O 3 , 64) and recent studies found magnetic toroidal order in LiCoPO 4 , 65,66) magnetic quadrupole order in Sr 2 IrO 4 67, 68) and Ba(TiO)Cu 4 (PO 4 ) 4 , 69) and odd-parity electric order in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 . 70,71) Recent theoretical study has also identified magnetic hexadecapole order in BaMn 2 As 2 . 57) Furthermore, a comprehensive group theoretical classification has identified more than <measure type="interval">100 </measure>compounds as odd-parity magnetic multipole states. 61) These multipole states spontaneously break * yanase@scphys.kyoto-u.ac.jp global inversion symmetry. The combined effects of spontaneous parity violation and sublattice-dependent ASOC may lead to fascinating magnetic, superconducting, and transport phenomena. For instance, Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov superconductivity by multipole order has been suggested, 50) and possible realization in Sr 2 IrO 4 was proposed. 72) In this paper, we study magnetic and magnetoelectric transport properties in the electric octupole (EO) state of bilayer Rashba systems, which was previously proposed for Sr 3 Ru 2 O 7 . 55,56) Owing to the layer degrees of freedom, the EO state is realized by antiferroic stacking of the even-parity electric quadrupole (EQ) moment between bilayers. Spin texture characteristic of the EO state appears in the momentum space. 55) Therefore, intriguing magnetoelectric responses may arise from hidden spin polarization in the EO state.</p><p>We discuss high-temperature cuprate superconductors as a possible candidate. Recently, a magnetic-torque measurement explored second-order phase transition around the pseudogap onset temperature in a bilayer cuprate superconductor YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−x (YBCO). 73) A kink in the magnetic torque indicates a change in the nematicity at the critical point. However, nematic order breaking the C 4 rotation symmetry can not be a primary order parameter since the C 4 rotation symmetry is already broken in the orthorhombic YBCO owing to CuO chains. Indeed, the critical exponent observed in experiments 73) indicates that the nematicity is not a primary order parameter. On the other hand, optical measurements such as linear dichroism <measure type="interval">74</measure>) and second-harmonic optical anisotropy 75) measurements have shown broken inversion symmetry. Thus, the hidden order in cuprates may be attributed to the EO order which is closely related to the nematicity and breaks inversion symmetry. In this paper, consistency with magnetic torque measurements 73) is demonstrated. Furthermore, the spin Hall effect and Edelstein effect are calculated, and their characteristic properties are proposed for future experimental tests. This paper is constructed as follows. First, in Sec. 2.1 we introduce the forward scattering model for bilayer Rashba systems and formulate a mean field theory. Next, we introduce EQ and EO order in Sec. 2.2. In Sec. 3, we study the EO state in an orthorhombic system and discuss the recent experimental result in YBCO. In Sec. 3.1 it is shown that the nematicity changes at the phase transition temperature of EO order. As a consequence, a kink appears in magnetic torque in agreement with the experiment 73) (Sec. 3.2). Furthermore, in Sec. 3.3 we show that in-plane anisotropy in magnetic susceptibility is remarkably enhanced in the superconducting state. Transport properties characterizing the EO state are elucidated in Secs. 4 and 5. We calculate the spin Hall conductivity in Sec. 4 and the Edelstein effect in Sec. 5. In addition to high-T c cuprate superconductors, the spin-orbit coupled metallic state in Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 is briefly discussed. Finally, summary and discussions are given in Sec. 6.</p><p>where c ksl (c † ksl ) is an annihilation (creation) operator of an electron with spin s =↑, ↓ and wave vector k on a layer l = A, B. n kl = s c † ksl c ksl is number density operator, σ = (σ x , σ y , σ z ) is the Pauli matrices, and N is the number of sites per layer. In the kinetic energy term H kin , ε k is represented by the nearest-and next-nearest-neighbour hoppings in a <measure type="value">two</measure>-dimensional (2D) square lattice, ε k = −2t x cos k x − 2t y cos k y − 4t 2 cos k x cos k y − µ, where the chemical potential µ is included. The nearest neighbour hoppings are given by</p><p>where δt 1 introduces an orthorhombic anisotropy in the 2D plane. Thus, δt 1 = <measure type="value" ptr="#1c0e4f32-df64-4007-838e-078bf23b566b">0 </measure>in the tetragonal system while δt 1 0 in the orthorhombic system such as YBCO. We adopt t 1 = 1 as the unit of energy. The second term H ASOC stands for layer-dependent Rashba ASOC. Since the parity-violating crystalline electric field is opposite between the two <quantifiedObject id="1c0e4f32-df64-4007-838e-078bf23b566b">layers</quantifiedObject>, the coupling constant has the form (α A , α B ) = (α, −α). This layer-dependent Rashba ASOC has been observed in recent spin-and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy for a bilayer cuprate superconductor Bi2212, 76) and a sizable magnitude α ∼ <measure type="value">10</measure>meV was reported. In accordance with Ref. 76, We assume a simple form g k = (− sin k y , sin k x , 0), which has been microscopically derived when the orbital degrees of freedom are quenched. 77) The third term H ⊥ represents the interlayer hopping of electrons. Assuming quasi-2D bilayer systems, a small interlayer hopping amplitude is taken as t ⊥ = <measure type="value">0.1</measure>.</p><p>In this subsection, we identify electric multipole order. For simplicity, a tetragonal system with δt 1 = <measure type="value" ptr="#a855c673-260d-4d94-9cfd-0226094f2a20">0 </measure>is considered. Then, the bilayer Rashba system preserves D 4h point group symmetry. The dPI order parameter on the l-layer is Isingtype, namely, ∆ l = ∆ or −∆. By taking account of layer degrees of freedom, we can identify two <quantifiedObject id="a855c673-260d-4d94-9cfd-0226094f2a20">types </quantifiedObject>of electric multipole states from the viewpoint of symmetry.</p><p>In contrast to the EQ state, the energy spectrum is <measure type="value">fourfold </measure>symmetric because rotoinversion symmetry is preserved.</p><p>In this paper we aim to explore electromagnetic responses in the parity-violating EO state. Although previous studies focused on the tetragonal system, 55,56) a candidate material, YBCO, is an orthorhombic compound. Therefore, in this section we study characteristic properties of the EO state in orthorhombic systems and discuss consistency with a recent experiment for YBCO. 73) Since the crystal structure of YBCO contains quasi-onedimensional CuO chains, crystal symmetry belongs to orthorhombic D 2h point group. C 4 rotation symmetry is slightly broken, that is, weak nematicity appears in the normal state. 89) For such orthorhombic systems we here assume anisotropy in the energy dispersion, δt 1 0. Because symmetry of the normal state is equivalent to the EQ state, EQ order can not be a second order phase transition. On the other hand, EO order can be a second order phase transition since it is accompanied by spontaneous inversion symmetry breaking. When EO order occurs, symmetry is reduced from D 2h to C 2v lacking inversion symmetry. In contrast to the tetragonal EO state, the orthorhombic EO state is polar, in the sense that the electric polarization is allowed. Thus, the EO moment coexists with the electric dipole moment. A set of parameters (t 1 , t 2 , t ⊥ , δt 1 , α, µ) = (<measure type="interval">1.0, −0.25</measure>, <measure type="list">0.1, 0.05, 0.05</measure>, −0.6) is consistent with Fermi surfaces in YBCO. 90,91) Thus, the parameter set is adopted in this section, unless mentioned otherwise. To discuss the EO state, we set (g 1 , g 2 ) = (<measure type="value">0.9, −0.25</measure>).</p><p>Let us show the order parameter and the nematicity in Fig. 2. The dPI parameter ∆ l defined by Eq. (8) represents the nematicity on the l-layer. Because fourfold rotation symmetry is originally broken in the orthorhombic system, both ∆ A and ∆ B are finite. Thus, ∆ l can not be an order parameter of symmetry breaking second order phase transition. However, the order parameter of the EO state is well-defined by ∆ EO = (∆ B − ∆ A )/2, which implies the degree of inversion symmetry breaking. Figure 2 shows appearance of ∆ EO below the critical temperature T c ≃ <measure type="value">0.1127 </measure>with a mean field critical exponent. Recent experimental studies actually reported the second order phase transition at the onset temperature of pseudogap in YBCO. 73,92) We here define the nematicity of the system by ∆ N = (∆ A + ∆ B )/2. As we see in the lower right panel of Fig. 2, the nematicity shows a kink at the critical temperature. This is consistent with the fact that the nematicity is not a primary order parameter, but it is coupled with the EO order.</p><p>, and ω n = <measure type="value">2</measure>nπT are boson Matsubara frequencies. We now consider the uniform and static spin susceptibility and take the limit (q, ω n ) → (0, 0). Then, the spin susceptibility is obtained as where</p><p>While Kramers theorem ensures E k1 = E k2 and E k3 = E k4 in the normal state, such <measure type="value">twofold </measure>degeneracy in the electronic band structure is lifted in the EO state. The second term of the Pauli susceptibility in Eq. (35) comes from the <measure type="value">twofold </measure>degeneracy. This term indeed disappears in the EO state [Eq. (37)]. Hence, a part of the Pauli susceptibility in the normal state changes to the Van Vleck susceptibility in the EO state, as shown by the second term in Eq. (38). This is important for the spin susceptibility in the superconducting state (see Sec. 3.3). Figure 3(a) shows the calculated temperature dependence of the magnetic torque, i.e., χ yy − χ xx . Owing to the layerdependent Rashba ASOC term, the spin susceptibility is anisotropic in the whole temperature region. We find a pronounced kink at around <quantifiedObject id="6a3b75dc-15dd-47f2-8d9c-b400ccb21007">T c </quantifiedObject>≃ <measure type="value" ptr="#6a3b75dc-15dd-47f2-8d9c-b400ccb21007">0.1127 </measure>consistent with experimental observation. 73) The kink appears at the transition temperature of EO order. A similar change in the nematicity was also observed in the Nernst effect. 93) The magnetic torque shows linear temperature dependence near the critical point, χ yy (T ) − χ xx (T ) − χ yy (T c ) − χ xx (T c ) ∝ T c − T , because the nematicity is a secondary order parameter of EO order. On the other hand, when EQ order occurs in a tetragonal system, square root behavior ∝ (T c −T ) 1/2 is expected below T c , which disagrees with the experiment.</p><p>Although the kink at the critical point of EO order is a generally obtained, detailed temperature dependence of the magnetic torque depends on parameters of the model. For small δt <quantifiedObject id="39fba068-cc01-4438-82d1-eabe93f278dd">1 </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#39fba068-cc01-4438-82d1-eabe93f278dd">0.02 </measure>and <quantifiedObject id="cdafad7a-a590-49aa-847d-0a28a7e2f3eb">α </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#cdafad7a-a590-49aa-847d-0a28a7e2f3eb">0.01</measure>, the magnitude of the magnetic torque increases below the EO transition temperature [inset of Fig. 3(a)]. This temperature dependence is consistent with the magnetic torque measurement. 73) Consistency with outof-plane magnetic anisotropy is also shown in Appendix B. Note that the magnetic torque disappears in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. At α = <measure type="value">0</measure>, indeed, we obtain an isotropic form</p><p>which leads to χ yy − χ xx = <measure type="value">0</measure>. The layer-dependent Rashba spin-orbit coupling plays an essential role for the kink in the magnetic torque.</p><p>Here we discuss the effect of EO order in the superconducting state. For this purpose we show the Van Vleck spin susceptibility. Figure 4 shows in-plane anisotropy of the Van Vleck spin susceptibility χ VV yy −χ VV xx . Comparison with χ yy −χ xx plotted in the same figure reveals a remarkably large in-plane anisotropy in the Van Vleck spin susceptibility, that is furthermore enhanced in the EO state. The Van Vleck spin susceptibility coincides with the spin susceptibility in the spin-singlet superconducting state at <quantifiedObject id="0b937dcf-a02f-451e-85cb-e46202c3df85">T </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#0b937dcf-a02f-451e-85cb-e46202c3df85">0 </measure>when the band splitting energy is much lager than the superconducting gap. 96) Therefore, the result in Fig. 4 indicates that in-plane anisotropy of spin susceptibility is significantly enhanced in the superconducting state.

Another care is required for discussion of high-temperature cuprate superconductors because the superconducting gap may be larger than the spin splitting energy ∆ so due to EO order.

Therefore, the anisotropy decreases with increasing hole doping in the superconducting state if EO order disappears at the quantum critical point.</p><p>Using the mean field Hamiltonian in the band basis [Eq. (14)], we obtain the analytic form of the spin Hall conductivity, which is separated into the <measure type="value" ptr="#d2fc2e20-1fbf-49d7-8741-1548acb39740">two </measure><quantifiedObject id="d2fc2e20-1fbf-49d7-8741-1548acb39740">terms</quantifiedObject>,</p><p>The spin Hall conductivity comes from the interband contributions to the correlation function. The first term σ SHE(C) µν originates from band splitting between {E k1 , E k2 } and {E k3 , E k4 }.

Thus, the local parity violation gives rise to the spin Hall effect even when the global in-version symmetry is preserved. On the other hand, the second term σ SHE(NC) µν results from lifting of band degeneracy due to parity violation. Since the EO state spontaneously breaks inversion symmetry, spin-orbit coupling gives the second term σ SHE(NC) µν . The analytic form for σ SHE xy is</p><p>From Eq. (57), we have D ab (k) = <measure type="value">0 </measure>when E ka = E kb . Thus, the spin Hall conductivity comes from the interband contribution. Using the retarded Green function in the band basis</p><p>In this subsection, we consider the tetragonal system and set δt 1 = <measure type="value">0</measure>, t 2 = <measure type="value">0.35</measure>. Here we compare the spin Hall effect in the EQ and EO states. First, Fig. 6 shows the spin Hall conductivity σ SHE xy , σ SHE(C) xy , and σ SHE(NC) xy as a function of the chemical potential. When we assume a parameter set (α, g 1 , g 2 ) = (<measure type="value">0.1</measure>, <measure type="list">0.45</measure>, <measure type="value">0.05</measure>), the EQ state is stable at around <quantifiedObject id="28187b36-c46e-4f12-8230-d963f1769143">µ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#28187b36-c46e-4f12-8230-d963f1769143">1.3</measure>. On the other hand, the EO state is stable at <measure type="value">1.2669 </measure>&lt; µ &lt; <measure type="interval">1.2875 </measure>for (α, g 1 , g 2 ) = (<measure type="value">0.35</measure>, <measure type="list">0.45, −0.05</measure>). Note that in a large ASOC region, sign of g 2 mainly determines the stability of the EQ and EO states. 56) In normal and EQ states, σ SHE xy = σ SHE(C) xy since σ SHE(NC) xy vanishes. Therefore, an effect of EQ order on the spin Hall conductivity is not visible in Fig. 6(a). This is because the inversion symmetry is preserved in the EQ state.</p><p>On the other hand, the spin Hall conductivity shows a pronounced feature in the EO state. As shown by Fig. 6(b), not only σ SHE(C) xy but also σ SHE(NC) xy are finite in the EO state, and the magnitude of the <measure type="value">two </measure>terms is comparable. Therefore, the spin Hall conductivity σ SHE xy is almost doubled in the EO state with a discontinuous jump at the phase boundaries.</p><p>Next, Fig. 7 shows the spin Hall conductivity as a function of the forward scattering coupling constant g 1 . Figure 7(a) reveals that the spin Hall conductivity does not show discontinuity at the critical point of EQ order, consistent with Fig. 6(a). The spin Hall conductivity shows a peak around the Lifshitz transition point where the Fermi surface changes the topology [see the inset of Fig. 6(a)]. On the other hand, in Fig. 7(b), σ SHE xy shows a jump at the critical point of the EO state, consistent with Fig. 6(b). However, the spin Hall conductivity is suppressed by further increasing g 1 &gt; <measure type="interval">0.6</measure>, owing to cancellation of σ SHE(C) The temperature dependence of the spin Hall conductivity is plotted in Fig. 8. Results for g 1 = <measure type="value">0.6 </measure>and <quantifiedObject id="d589da0e-30d1-44dd-a6bf-691edfcce497">g 1 </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#d589da0e-30d1-44dd-a6bf-691edfcce497">0.45 </measure>are shown in Figs. 8(a) and 8(b), respectively. We see the jump in the spin Hall conductivity at the transition temperature of EO order in both parameters. This is a signature of parity violation, which can be tested by experiments. Although the spin Hall effect is suppressed at low temperatures for a large Hall conductivity is nearly temperature independent below T c since |∆ l | &lt; α| g k | at all temperatures. On the other hand, Fig. 8(c) reveals that the spin Hall effect does not show a signature of EQ order. In our calculation, the spin Hall conductivity shows a discontinuous jump because we take γ → +0. The discontinuity is smeared by a finite scattering rate γ. Fluctuation exchange approximation for the Hubbard model leads to γ ∼ <measure type="value">20</measure>meV at <quantifiedObject id="d404528e-6154-4ade-9036-017d7425cb8e">T </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#d404528e-6154-4ade-9036-017d7425cb8e">200K</measure>, 99) that is comparable to the spinorbit splitting ∆ so ∼ <measure type="value">10</measure>meV for the parameters adopted in Sec. 3.3. Therefore, although a considerable smearing effect would occur, rapid increase in the spin Hall effect is expected in the EO state. Finally, structure of the spin Hall conductivity tensor is discussed. We analytically confirmed σ SHE xy = −σ SHE yx in the EO state and σ SHE xx = σ SHE yy = <measure type="value">0 </measure>(see Appendix A). The former relation has been shown in the numerical results (Fig. 8). Thus, the transverse spin current is induced by the electric field, namely, J sz ⊥ E, irrespective of the direction of E. This relation breaks down when the C 4 rotation symmetry is broken, as we will show in the next subsection.</p><p>Since we have proved σ SHE xx = σ SHE yy = <measure type="value">0</measure>, the spin current in various electric field directions is obtained from Fig. 9. The result is illustrated in Fig. 10. Because of σ SHE xy −σ SHE yx , the spin current is no longer perpendicular to the electric field. The longitudinal spin current is induced when the electric field is applied away from the [100] and [010] directions. The deviation from the orthogonal relation, J sz ⊥ E, is enhanced for a larger g 1 .</p><p>Carrying out the unitary transformation, we obtain the band representation of spin operators S µ and charge current operators J ν . Then, the magnetoelectric tensor Υ µν is decomposed into the <measure type="value">three </measure>terms The first term Υ intra µν is the intraband term, while the others are the interband terms. As we did for the spin Hall conductivity [Eq. (50)], we separate the interband contribution into the <measure type="value">two </measure>terms Υ inter(C) µν and Υ inter(NC) µν . Let us show the analytic expression of Υ xy ,</p><p>Now we calculate the Edelstein effect in the tetragonal system by setting δt 1 = <measure type="value">0</measure>. Figure 11 shows the chemical potential dependence of the magnetoelectric coefficient Υ xy . In contrast to the spin Hall effect, the Edelstein effect does not occur in centrosymmetric systems. Therefore, Υ xy disappears in the normal state. On the other hand, a finite Υ xy is obtained in the EO state. Thus, the Edelstein effect is a signature of parity-violating electric order. 61) It is shown that Υ xy is mainly given by the intraband contribution Υ intra xy , i.e., |Υ intra xy | ≫ |Υ inter(C) xy + Υ inter(NC) xy |. This is because the Edelstein effect is caused by the shift of Fermi surfaces under the electric current. We confirmed that the intraband contribution is dominant even for a large scattering rate, e.g., <quantifiedObject id="dd00ecc2-70b7-40fb-9c71-664ff037c519">γ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#dd00ecc2-70b7-40fb-9c71-664ff037c519">0.1</measure>. In contrast to the magnetoelectric tensor Υ xy = −Υ yx in Rashba systems, Υ xy = Υ yx holds and others are <measure type="value">zero</measure>. Such magnetoelectric tensor has been shown by a group-theoretical analysis, 61) although the x axis is rotated by <measure type="value">45 degrees</measure>. The difference from Rashba systems is intuitively understood by considering the spin texture in the momentum space; k yx +k xŷ for D 2d symmetry while −k yx + k xŷ for C 4v symmetry. 61) The non-polar EO state corresponds to the former, and the polar Rashba system corresponds to the latter. Reflecting the characteristic spin texture due to D 2d point group symmetry, the EO state shows a characteristic electric-field-angle dependence of the magnetic moment in Fig. 12. The longitudinal magnetoelectric response, M E, occurs for E [110], while the transverse response, M ⊥ E, occurs for E [100]. This unique field-angle dependence is distinct from Rashba systems and chiral crystals; M ⊥ E in polar Rashba systems, 2, 4, 7-9, 21, 22) while M E in chiral crystals 103) lacking mirror symmetry. Thus, the Edelstein effect can distinguish the symmetry of electron systems. The Edelstein effect of D 2d -type may be observed in the spin-orbit coupled metallic state of Cd 2 Re 2 O 7 . Below the structural transition temperature <quantifiedObject id="7129e2ae-9eca-4787-9a58-0159bd19a00d">T s </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#7129e2ae-9eca-4787-9a58-0159bd19a00d">200K</measure>, the crystal symmetry is reduced from cubic O h to tetragonal D 2d . 70) From the viewpoint of symmetry, the transition has been identified as electric dotriacontapole order 61) or electric toroidal quadrupole order. 63) Although the electronic state and relevant multipole moment are different from our bilayer model, symmetry of the low temperature phase is the same as the EO state. Therefore, qualitatively the same magnetoelectric transport is expected.</p><p>We turn to the orthorhombic system, and set δt 1 = <measure type="value">0.05</measure>. Symmetry of the EO state belongs to the noncentrosymmetric and polar C 2v point group, and therefore, structure of the magnetoelectric tensor is different from the tetragonal EO state with D 2d symmetry.</p><p>First, we show the results for g 1 = <measure type="value">0.9 </measure>and <quantifiedObject id="c7e7d9cb-c3a2-4a56-8fe8-5e4238451612">g 2 = </quantifiedObject>in Fig. 13. The temperature dependence of Υ µν reveals appearance of the Edelstein effect in the EO state. In contrast to the tetragonal system, the relation Υ xy = Υ yx does not hold in the orthorhombic EO state. Moreover, signs of −Υ xy and −Υ yx are opposite. This structure of the magnetoelectric tensor results in nearly transverse magnetoelectric effect, M ⊥ E, shown in Fig. 13(b). Then, the field-angle dependence is similar to the Rashba system with C 4v point group symmetry. The field-angle dependence significantly changes when the forward scattering interaction is increased. Figure 14 obtained for g 1 = <measure type="value">1.0 </measure>and g 2 = <measure type="value">−0.35 </measure>shows Υ xy ∼ Υ yx . Thus, the Edelstein effect is similar to that in the EO state of tetragonal systems. The electric-field-angle dependence plotted in Fig. 14(b) actually resembles Fig. 12.</p><p>From these results, it is implied that the Edelstein effect changes from the C 4v -type to the D 2d -type with increasing the EO moment. This crossover is allowed by symmetry, because the <quantifiedObject id="b1ad31e3-6cac-4ac3-b3c5-4d09a6ea821f">C 2v point group </quantifiedObject>of the orthorhombic EO state is a subgroup of C 4v and D 2d . Intuitively speaking, a large EO moment with D 2d symmetry causes the Edelstein effect of the D 2d -type. In our model, the crossover is accompanied by the Lifshitz transition of Fermi surfaces.

In the latter case, where ∆ EO ≫ δt 1 , nearly fourfold symmetric Fermi surfaces resemble those in D 2d systems. Accordingly, the Edelstein effect is almost D 2d -type.</p><p>A key is time-reversal symmetry. Time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the EO state, although the time-reversal symmetry breaking magnetoelectric multipole <measure type="value">109,110</measure>) and loopcurrent 111) have been proposed for the order parameter of pseudogap phase in cuprate superconductors. Polarized neutron scattering measurements <measure type="value">112,113</measure>) and a polar Kerr effect measurement 114) supported broken time-reversal symmetry. However, these experiments reported different onset temperatures, and thus, interpretation of the data is still unsettled.</p><p>For a future experimental test, we showed remarkably large in-plane anisotropy of spin susceptibility in the superconducting state. The anisotropy may be <measure type="value">100 </measure>times larger than that in the normal state. Such large anisotropy comes from the Van Vleck spin susceptibility. A NMR Knight shift measurement is proposed to detect highly anisotropic spin susceptibility.</p><p>Furthermore, we investigated magnetoelectric transport properties in the EO state, which are caused by spontaneous parity violation. The spin Hall effect and the kinetic magnetoelectric effect (Edelstein effect) were calculated on the basis of the linear response theory. We divided the spin Hall conductivity into the <measure type="value">two </measure>terms by Eq. (50). One is derived from the layer-dependent Rashba ASOC (σ SHE(C) µν ), and the other is given by the band splitting due to spontaneous parity violation in the EO state (σ SHE(NC) µν ). Owing to the appearance of the latter term, the spin Hall conductivity shows a discontinuous enhancement in the EO state. On the other hand, no noticeable change in the spin Hall conductivity is observed at the critical point of nematic (EQ) order. Thus, the EO state and nematic state can be distinguished by measuring the spin Hall effect. The Edelstein effect, namely, current-induced spin polarization occurs in the EO state, although it does not occur in the nematic state. This is because the Edelstein effect is prohibited in centrosymmetric systems. Measurements of Edelstein effect would give a constraint on symmetry of the pseudogap state.</p></text>
