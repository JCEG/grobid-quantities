enough large-size single crystals of H-doped Sm1111, which restricts more detailed investigations on the superconducting mechanism and the electronic band structure by experimental methods such like angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.We therefore propose another synthesis approach in order to make future studies on H-doped Sm1111 accessible. Here, we report on large size heteroepitaxial thin-film samples on single-crystalline substrates with a usual lateral size of 10mm × 10mm. Just after the report by Kamihara et al. in 2008 [1], extensive synthesis and research did not only start on bulk samples (polycrystalline and single crystals) but also thin film growth -especially epitaxial films -was stimulated world wide [8,9,15,16]. Pulsed laser deposition (PLD) turned out to be the most compatible technique also for Fe-based superconductors and has been employed mainly because of the historical success in the growth of high-T c cuprate thin films and coated conductors. It is important to note here that until today epitaxial ReFeAsO thin films could not been grown by PLD equipped with an ultraviolet KrF excimer laser (λ = 248 nm). A KrF laser in a room-temperature deposition was employed only for chemical transfer before a post-deposition thermal annealing of La1111 films [17,18]. Hiramatsu et al. [19] thus employed a Nd:YAG laser, instead of an ultraviolet excimer laser as an excitation for the PLD process, initially demonstrating in-situ La1111 heteroepitaxial growth. Utilizing this Nd:YAG PLD system, Haindl et al. [20][21][22][23] recently realized in-situ PLD growth of high-quality undoped and F-doped Sm1111 epitaxial films. At present, besides PLD, molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is a common technique for the in-situ growth of 1111-type ReFeAsO films [24,25], and metal-organic chemical vapor deposition has made progress in the fabrication of 1111-type ReFeAsO films [26]. Our studies on in-situ PLD growth of ReFeAsO imply that the optimization of growth conditions is severe irrespective of use 5 of a Nd:YAG laser for ablation [21,22] and any attempts to achieve in-situ PLD growth of H-doped Sm1111 epitaxial films failed so far. Even our initial efforts in a reactive PLD process demonstrated that hydrogen could not be doped into epitaxial Sm1111 films when H 2 gas and rf-generated H radical gas were introduced into the growth chamber during deposition experiments, which will be discussed later in Fig. S1. The essential key in this study is a topotactic chemical reaction between undoped Sm1111 epitaxial films, grown by the Nd:YAG PLD, and CaH 2 powder using a unique post-deposition thermal annealing experimental setup. We successfully demonstrate the high-T c bulk superconductivity at 48 K of H-doped Sm1111 epitaxial films on MgO single-crystalline substrates and would lead to future experimental validation of mechanism of high-T c superconductivity of 1111-type Fe-based superconductors. film. In step 1, the precursor (#1) was capped by a YSZ single-crystalline plate and put into an alumina vessel filled with CaH 2 powder. In step 2 the alumina vessel is closed.In step 3 the vessel was subsequently sealed in a silica-glass ampule and thermally annealed in vacuum at 500°C for 24h. The resulting H-doped Sm1111 film is denoted as #2. (c) Heavily H-doped Sm1111 epitaxial thin film: In step 1, the precursor film was inserted into a silica-glass tube that was filled with CaH 2 powder. In step 2 the tube was sealed under vacuum and then thermally annealed at 500 ºC for 24h. The heavily H-doped Sm1111 film is denoted as #3. Figure 1a shows growth process of undoped Sm1111 heteroepitaxial thin films. PLD using second harmonics (λ = 532 nm) of a Nd:YAG laser ablated undoped Sm1111 polycrystalline disks and deposited the films on MgO single-crystalline substrates (size: 10mm × 10mm × 0.5mm), heated at 900ºC with an infrared semiconductor laser, under a high vacuum atmosphere (base pressure: ~1×10 -6 Pa). The MgO substrate was thermally annealed at 1050 ºC in air before deposition. The thicknesses of all the undoped Sm1111 films were fixed to be ~80 nm. The Nd:YAG PLD-film-growth procedure was carried out according to the details reported in refs. [19][20][21][22]. These undoped Sm1111 epitaxial films grown by the Nd:YAG PLD are called precursor films (#1) and serve as starting point in this study. Although we initially attempted H-doping of Sm1111 epitaxial films by in-situ growth under H 2 gas and rf-generated H radical atmospheres as well as by post-deposition thermal annealing treatment under H 2 atmosphere, no H-doped Sm1111 films could be obtained. To efficiently dope H into the Sm1111 epitaxial films, we therefore performed a topotactic chemical reaction using an active solid H-source, which is CaH 2 polycrystalline powder, through two different experimental approaches (Figs. 1 b,c). The topotactic chemical reaction we expected for both was SmFeAsO + (x/2)CaH 2 → SmFeAs(O 1−x H x ) + (x/2)CaO. Figure 1b represents the first approach, which is based on our previous reports on heteroepitaxial growth of materials composed of high vapor pressure elements such as K [27,28]. The precursor film (#1) was put at the bottom of an alumina vessel, which was preliminary paved by large amounts of CaH 2 powder to keep high H vapor pressure during subsequent thermal annealing process, and then capped with a Y-stabilized ZrO 2 (YSZ) single-crystal plate to protect surface of the undoped Sm1111 film. More CaH 2 powder was put on the YSZ plate, and then sealed with an alumina top cover. Finally, the alumina vessel was thermally annealed in an evacuated silica-glass ampule at 500 ºC for 24 h. The resulting H-doped film is defined as sample #2. The second approach resulted in heavy H-doped films (#3) that were fabricated through two steps similar with #2 as shown in Fig 1c. Here, the precursor film (#1) was directly filled together with large amounts of CaH 2 powder in silica-glass tube and subsequently sealed under a vacuum atmosphere in silica-glass ampule, i.e., this approach does not employ a film surface protection with YSZ and efficiently promotes the topotactic reaction and diffusion of hydrogen into the film. The final thermal annealing process condition is carried out under the same conditions as that for #2.The crystalline phases and structure parameters such as lattice parameters were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with monochromated Cu Kα 1 radiation. The crystallinity and crystallographic orientation of resulting Sm1111 films were evaluated by X-ray rocking-curve measurements at the Sm1111 003 diffraction for the out-of-plane direction and at the Sm1111 200 diffraction for the in-plane direction.Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) with high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) and annular bright-field (ABF) modes was employed for the observation of atomic-scale cross-sectional microstructure. H concentration [x in SmFeAs(O 1-x H x )] of the H-doped Sm1111 epitaxial films was quantitatively determined from depth profiles obtained by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) using a polycrystalline SmFeAs(O 0.4 H 0.6 ) bulk sample [13] as a standard sample. Temperature (T) dependence of the electrical resistivity (ρ) was measured using four-probe method with Au electrodes from 2 K to 300 K under magnetic fields up to 9 T. Magnetization was characterized at T = 4−300 K using zero-field cooling (ZFC) and field cooling (FC) at 10 Oe to confirm the bulk superconductivity in the H-doped Sm1111 films #2 and #3 (i.e., complete diamagnetism).Before we employed the topotactic chemical reaction using CaH 2 powder as an active H-source for H doping, we preliminarily attempted H doping during reactive in-situ PLD film-growth as well as by post-deposition thermal annealing under H 2 atmosphere. Figure S1 summarizes the resultant XRD patterns and ρ−T curves in each employed process. Figures S1a and S1c display H pressure (P H2 ) dependence of obtained crystalline phases, where H 2 gas and rf-generated H radical gas were introduced into the vacuum chamber for PLD growth during the film growth experiments, respectively. In both processes, impurity phases such as SmAs segregated with the increase in P H2 .Furthermore, their ρ−T behavior maintained insulator-like [19, 20, 29 -31] as shown in Figs. S1b for H 2 -gas growth and S1d for growth with the rf-H radical source. Then, we performed post-deposition thermal annealing under H 2 gas atmosphere for as-grown Sm1111 epitaxial thin films, which were deposited under a high vacuum at 800 ºC.Figures S1e and S1f are XRD patterns and ρ−T curves before and after the annealing, respectively. Similar to both above attempts of a reactive in-situ growth, this post-deposition annealing process could not induce a superconducting transition either.These results suggested that hydrogen was not substituted for oxygen probably due to the strong chemical bonding between O and Sm within the O-Sm layers of the layered crystal structure.Thus, we performed a post-deposition thermal annealing on undoped precursor films using the binary hydride CaH 2 as a more active solid H-source in order to achieve high [11]). This would originate from lattice strain due to heteroepitaxial growth.In the case of H-doping of Sm1111 polycrystalline bulks, the lattice parameters continuously decrease both along a-and c-axes with increasing H concentration x [11]. Accordingly, the lattice parameters of our epitaxial films also shrank in the order from #1, #2 (a = 3.912 and c = 8.534 Å), to #3 (a = 3.903 and c = 8.488 Å). This implies indirectly that an increasing amount of H is incorporated into the Sm1111 epitaxial films in this sample numbering order.We then observed atomic-scale microstructure of the sample #3, in which the highest H concentration was expected based on the above lattice parameters' analysis. Figure 3a shows wide-view cross-sectional microstructure. Originating from its layered crystal structure, alternately stacking patterns along the c-axis were clearly observed from interface to film surface without any defects such as dislocations in this scale, validating its high film-quality. The interface shown in the inset was very sharp (i.e., heteroepitaxial growth starts from a few atomic layers.), indicating that any chemical reaction between the film and the MgO does not occur during the in-situ PLD growth and the post-deposition thermal annealing. The atomic resolution HAADF-STEM image (Fig. 3b) indicates that the observed image is atomically consistent with the 1111-type layered structure. But we could not observe clear Z-contrast originating from H substitution at O site in this image because the contrast of neighbor Sm, which bonds with O, was too bright with respect to O signals. It should be noted that in Fig. 3c we attained clear experimental evidence for hydrogen substitution at O site by ABF-STEM.In this figure, originating from its bright-field characteristics, the darkest and largest ones are Sm positions, and some O atoms at O sites are indicated by yellow arrows. We found that brighter positions indicated by light blue arrows also exist at the same O sites. This observation result is the clear experimental evidence that doped H substitutes at the O site and it is completely disordered. This substitution is also confirmed in the intensity plot at the bottom of Fig. 3(c). films, where H contents around film surface were employed as x. Open red circles and blue squares correspond to those of H-doped Sm1111 polycrystalline bulks [11].Next, we measured the electronic transport properties of samples #1 -#3. Figures 6a and 6b show ρ−T curves in temperature ranging between 2−300K and 35−54K, respectively. The undoped Sm1111 epitaxial precursor film (#1) exhibited insulator-like behavior, which has been also observed in other 1111-type epitaxial thin films [19, 20, 29 -31], in contrast to a metallic resistivity in undoped Sm1111 bulks [11]. According to its undoped characteristics, ρ anomaly, which is probably due to an antiferromagnetic transition similar to bulk [11], was observed as indicated by the vertical arrow (T N ). In the H-doped films (#2, #3) a clear metallic resistivity was observed. ρ−T in the T region higher than 50 K. We performed a power-law fitting for the normal states using an equation ρ = α + βT n , where α and β are constants. The exponent n values of normal state were 1.1 for #2 and 0.6 for #3, which are roughly consistent with those of bulks (1.15 at x = 0.13 and 0.88 at x = 0.34) [11]. In the T region lower than 50 K, sharp drops of ρ at 45.2 K for #2 and 47.9 K for #3 indicated a superconducting transition. Although zero resistance was not detected down to 2 K in #2 owing to inhomogeneous and low H concentration, #3 exhibited clear zero resistance at 44.5 K. To confirm its bulk superconductivity state, we measured magnetization as a function of T. Figure 6c shows results of FC and ZFC curves of #2 (blue) and #3 (red). From these results, we concluded that these sharp transitions in ρ−T curves originate from a bulk superconducting state rather than surface superconductivity.This result is the first demonstration of superconductivity in Sm1111 epitaxial thin films by hydrogen doping. The critical temperature T c determined from electronic and magnetic measurements is summarized in Fig. 6d and Table 1. The T c onset of our films fit 20 well to the dome-shaped superconducting phase obtained from polycrystalline bulks, even though the absolute values of T c were slightly lower compared to the bulk samples probably due to the influence of strain introduced via thin-film growth process. The shielding volume fraction (SVF) was small for #2 (1 %), whereas that of #3 (24.5 %) was enough to judge its bulk superconductivity although it was smaller compared with polycrystalline bulks (79 % for x = 0.13 and 77 % for x = 0.34) [11]. This relatively small SVF could be attributed to the inhomogeneous H concentration along the film thickness as observed by SIMS (Fig. 4c).We demonstrated the high-T c superconductivity up to 48 K of H-doped 1111-typeThe authors declare no competing interests.
