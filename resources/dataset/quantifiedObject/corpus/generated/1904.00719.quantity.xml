[1,2] A central still open issue concerning this phenomenology is the description of the rounding behavior shown around the superconducting critical temperature, T c , by different observables. It was early proposed that at least in optimally-doped cuprates (OPT HTSC) these roundings are due to the presence of conventional superconducting fluctuations, i.e., to the presence of fluctuating superconducting pairs created by the unavoidable thermal agitation energy [3][4][5][6][7][8]. In fact, in a wide temperature interval, above but not too close to T c (above the so-called Ginzburg-Levanyuk temperature) and well below the rounding onset temperature, these effects in OPT HTSC were well described in terms of the phenomenological mean-field Gaussian-Ginzburg-Landau (GGL) approach for the superconducting fluctuations of both the amplitude and the phase of the order parameter in multilayered superconductors [3][4][5][6][7][8]. This conclusion was supported, e.g., by measurements of the magnetization rounding above T c (the socalled precursor diamagnetism) [7][8][9][10] and of the in-plane electrical resistivity rounding (the so-called paraconductivity) [7,8,[11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24]. These <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>observables are not only crucial to characterize the superconducting transition but, in addition, in HTSC they present an excellent ratio between the extent of the rounding effects and the corresponding background or bare contributions (orders of magnitude bigger than, for instance, in the heat capacity) [3,8].</p><p>In applying the mean field GGL approach to the roundings observed above the superconducting transition in HTSC, it was used as critical temperature, T c , the experimental transition temperature at which both the Meissner and the resistivity transitions occur. Moreover, as first stressed in Ref. [25], this approach predicts that in the mean-field-like region where it is applicable, the fluctuations effects on both observables, the paraconductivity and the precursor diamagnetism, will have the same dependence on the reduced temperature, ε ≡ ln(T /T c ). The confirmation of this prediction by measurements in different OPT HTSC (a result that will be extended in our present work to the high reduced temperature region, ε &gt; <measure type="value"><num>0.1</num></measure>) not only provided further support to the GGL scenario but also was an early indication of the absence of the so-called indirect fluctuation effects on both observables [25]. This conclusion concerns in particular the Maki-Thompson contribution to the in-plane paraconductivity [3][4][5]8,25], in agreement with the enhanced pair-breaking effects expected for the non-<measure type="value"><num>1 s 0 </num></measure>wave pairing in the HTSC [26,27]. The GL scenario was further supported by early scaling analyses of the electrical conductivity and the diamagnetism measured around T c (H) in the so-called critical region [28][29][30][31][32]. This GL scenario was also found compatible with the existence close to the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure>-field T c of a full-critical region where the mean-field-like approaches are no longer applicable. In this full-critical region the superconducting fluctuations have been described in terms of the XY model [11,12,[33][34][35].</p><p>Mainly in the last <measure type="value"><num>ten </num><measure type="TIME" unit="years">years</measure></measure>, however, different research groups, including some of the most influential, have proposed other physical mechanisms, different from the presence of conventional superconducting fluctuations, to account for the entire or a part of the measured rounding effects above T c in all the HTSC, including in those compounds where (as is the case of the optimally-doped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ , OPT Y-123), the rounding onsets are located relatively close to T c , below twice the measured superconducting critical temperature. [1,2, In some cases, these proposals were fueled by the observation in different HTSC, even in OPT Y-123, of seemingly intrinsic anomalous roundings around T c , non-describable in terms of the GL approaches summarized above. These anomalous roundings concern not only the in-plane magnetization [44][45][46][47] and the dc in-plane electrical conductivity [48,49], but also other observables, as the Nernst effect [47,[50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65][66]. Although some of these anomalies could in fact be attributed to T c inhomogeneities, associated with the presence of chemical disorder with long characteristics lengths (larger than the superconducting coherence length amplitude), unavoidable in non-stoichiometric compounds [67][68][69][70][71][72][73], most of the works published since then on that issue still attribute the measured rounding effects above T c to the opening of a pseudogap in the normal state. In this last scenario, the most popular mechanism is based on phase disordering. [1,2,[74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88][89][90][91] In these so-called phase incoherent superconductivity approaches the true pairing temperature will be well above the measured T c (where the Meissner and the resistivity transitions occurs), in some cases up to the temperature at which the normal state pseudogap opens. Such a seemingly broad region of short-range phase stiffness above the measured T c , and up to the pseudogap temperature, would support large vorticity, and the corresponding effects should be then much more important than those predicted by the conventional approaches based on the presence of fluctuating pairs above the mean-field critical temperature. [1,2,44,[74][75][76][77][78][79][80][81][82][83][84][85][86][87][88][89][90][91] The difficulties to discriminate between these very different theoretical scenarios proposed for the rounding effects around T c in HTSC are to some extent related to the unavoidable experimental uncertainties that arise when extracting the intrinsic roundings from the measurements. These uncertainties have in turn various, and often entangled, sources: First at all, those associated with the always somewhat arbitrary approximations needed to determine both the T c of each theoretical approach and the background or bare contributions, associated with the normal state behavior, to each</p><p>The difficulties commented before, some of them unavoidable, affect even the discrimination between the different versions of the GL scenarios proposed until now. In fact, in spite of earlier detailed measurements and analyses, aspects so central within these approaches as the possible presence of indirect fluctuation effects, the multilayering influence and the estimations of the corresponding effective periodicity lengths, the role of the chemical disorder and of the corresponding T c -inhomogeneities, the behavior at high reduced temperatures and magnetic fields, or the physical origin of the corresponding cutoffs, are still controversial. [93][94][95][96][97][98][99][100][101] In this paper, the experimental uncertainties commented above are strongly mitigated by measuring the rounding behavior of the in-plane electrical conductivity, the magnetoconductivity and the magnetization around T c in high quality OPT Y-123 samples. These measurements extend up to <measure type="interval"><num atMost="300">300 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>in temperature and up to 9 T in applied magnetic field amplitudes, that when analyzed on the grounds of the GL approaches cover both their low magnetic field limit (Schmidt regime) and moderate fields (or Prange) regime. In addition to their relevance to probe the superconducting transition, these observables were chosen because, as noted before, in HTSC they present an excellent ratio between the amplitudes of the rounding effects and the corresponding background or bare contributions associated with the normal state behavior. In turn, as also stressed before, the choice of the OPT Y-123 superconductor was first motivated by the high chemical and structural quality of the samples that may be prepared, what minimizes the T c -inhomogeneities. In addition, the normal-state resistivity and the magnetic susceptibility are linear in an extended temperature region, allowing a simple and reliable extraction of the background. In fact, these characteristics make OPT Y- ¶ The uncertainties associated with the background or bare contributions affect all the comparisons with the theoretical approaches for any second order phase transition in any system, and they have their origin in the fact that these approaches calculate the fluctuation contributions separately from the non-critical contributions [see, e.g., Ref. [92]]. So, these uncertainties are to some extent intrinsic to any experimental background estimation, included those obtained by trying to quench the superconductivity by high reduced magnetic fields.</p><p>The conductivity and the magnetization around T c in OPT Y-123... 123 the prototypical compound to analyze the rounding effects in HTSC, and in the last <measure type="value"><num>twenty </num><measure type="TIME" unit="years">years </measure></measure>these effects were extensively measured on it and analyzed in terms of superconducting fluctuations. [7-41, 44-67, <measure type="list"><num>93</num></measure>, 94, 96] However, as stressed before, our present experimental results on so central observables are performed in high quality samples and cover different magnetic field regimes and reduced temperatures, including the rounding onset temperature itself. They are, therefore, unique and particularly useful to discriminate between the different theoretical scenarios proposed until now. The presentation of these high-precision experimental data and the corresponding model-independent conclusions, that include a direct determination of the roundings' onset temperatures, is the first aim of this paper.</p><p>Our second central aim is to present quantitative and consistent analyses of these experimental results in terms of the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau (GL) approaches that take into account the fluctuating pairs contribution, by introducing thermal fluctuations of both the amplitude and the phase of the superconducting order parameter. <measure type="value"><num>Two </num></measure>main reasons justify the choice of these comparisons: The presence of fluctuating superconducting pairs is unavoidable around any superconducting transition and, in addition, until now the GL approaches provide the only scenario in which the current state of the theoretical calculations allows fully quantitative and simultaneous confrontations with explicit expressions for these rounding effects on so central observables. The comparisons summarized here include the extended (with a total-energy cutoff) Gaussian-Ginzburg-Landau (GGL) approach for multilayered superconductors above but not too close to T c (above the Ginzburg-Levanyuk reduced temperature) and, consistently, the GL scaling in the lowest-Landau-level (GL-LLL) approach for 3D superconductors in the critical region around T c (H). The total energy cutoff takes into account the quantum localization energy, associated with the shrinkage of the superconducting wavefunction, and allows us to extend the comparisons with the GL scenario up to the rounding onset itself. <measure type="value"><num>Two </num></measure>first conclusions for this GL scenario are going to be obtained by just comparing to each other the measured observables: the absence of indirect fluctuation effects on the in-plane paraconductivity and of non-local electrodynamic effects on the precursor diamagnetism, including the high reduced-temperature region. These analyses are going to demonstrate at a quantitative level, and for the first time up to the rounding onset temperatures, that the measured roundings around T c in the prototypical OPT Y-123 may be explained consistently in terms of the phenomenological GL scenario, based on the presence of fluctuating pairs. They will provide also precise information on the corresponding parameters arising in this GL scenario, including the effective interlayer periodicity length, the in-plane superconducting coherence length amplitude, the rounding onset temperature and the corresponding cutoff, and the relaxation time of the superconducting pairs relative to the BCS value.</p><p>to understand the so-called pseudogap of the HTSC, at present a debated issue and whose implications concern some of the proposals for the superconducting pairing origin. [1, 2, <measure type="list"><num>44</num></measure>-66, 102, 103] For instance, our results indicate that in OPT Y-123 the superconducting fluctuations are conventional and, therefore, at odds with pseudogap scenarios that assume, for OPT doping, unconventionaly large roundings due to anomalous phase-dominated superconducting fluctuations. In this paper we will also briefly comment on some of the scenarios for the pseudogap that are instead compatible with our present results, including, e.g., those in which the pseudogap temperature, T * , falls at optimal doping below the superconducting dome. Some other proposed scenarios for the measured rounding effects, such as the possibility of charge density wave effects [103][104][105], are also going to be briefly discussed.</p><p>The conductivity and the magnetization around T c in OPT Y-123... To determine the electrical conductivity and the magnetoconductivity roundings around T c we have grown OPT Y-123 thin films over (100) SrTiO 3 substrates by high-pressure dc sputtering. Details of the growth and characterization of these films are similar to those described elsewhere. [107] Microbridges were patterned on those films by photolithography and wet chemical etching into a <measure type="value"><num>four</num></measure>-probe configuration suitable for the electrical measurements. Au pads were then deposited onto the current and voltage terminals. The final contact resistance achieved was less than <measure type="interval"><num atMost="0.1">0.1 </num></measure>Ω/contact.

A detail of the resistive transition is presented in Fig. 1(b), where the solid line is dρ ab (T )/dT . The superconducting transition temperature T c , and the resistive transition width, ∆T c , are obtained as the temperature location of the maximum of the derivative peak and, respectively, its width at <measure type="value"><num>half </num></measure>maximum.

This is illustrated in Figs. 1(a) and (c). Such a linear behaviour was already observed in high-quality OPT Y-123 single-crystals and epitaxial thin films by different groups. [7, 8, <measure type="list"><num>11</num></measure>-<measure type="interval"><num atMost="25, 28">25, 28</num></measure>-36, <measure type="list"><num>40</num>, <num>108</num></measure>, 109] In addition, our microbridges present a normal-state resistivity ratio ρ ab (<measure type="value"><num>300</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K</measure></measure>)/ρ ab (<measure type="value"><num>100</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K</measure></measure>) around 3.1, as expected for OPT Y-123 [110]. Also, the extrapolation to T = <measure type="value"><num>0 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>of the normal state resistivity leads to very low residual values, as shown in Fig. 1(a). These results already suggest the absence of appreciable T c -inhomogeneities in our microbridges. In fact, the possible presence of a small amount of non-superconducting domains uniformly distributed in the samples could just affect the paraconductivity amplitude, a relatively small effect that may be expected to remain well below the uncertainties associated with the microbridges dimensions. [111] + + Note that an incomplete superconducting volume fraction (f &lt; <measure type="interval"><num atMost="1">1</num></measure>) would affect both the electrical resistivity and the magnetization, and then the extraction of the corresponding paraconductivity and precursor diamagnetism. In the case of the magnetization, independently of the spatial distribution of the non-superconducting domains, their presence will manifest only in the corresponding ∆χ(T, H) amplitude (and then only the H c2 (0) value resulting from the comparison with the GGL approach will be affected). The effects of the non-superconducting domains are more difficult to evaluate when</p><p>To measure the magnetization with H applied perpendicular to the superconducting ab-layers, M(T, H), we have used a high-quality OPT Y-123 single-crystal prepared following a previously reported self-flux technique. [12] It has a quite regular plate-like shape, with dimensions 2.3 × <measure type="value"><num>2.9 </num><measure type="?" unit="mm 2">mm 2 </measure></measure>in the ab plane and a thickness of <measure type="value"><num>40 </num><measure type="LENGTH" unit="µm">µm</measure></measure>.

The magnetization measurements were performed with a magnetometer based in the superconducting quantum interference (Quantum Design, model MPMS-XL).</p><p>A first magnetic characterization of our crystal was obtained through the temperature dependence of the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure>-field-cooling (ZFC) magnetic susceptibility (χ) under a low magnetic field (<measure type="value"><num>0.25 </num><measure type="MAGNETIC_INDUCTION" unit="mT">mT</measure></measure>) perpendicular to the ab layers ( Fig. 3(a)). From this curve one may obtain the diamagnetic transition temperature, T c , as the temperature at which dχ/dT is maximum (T c = <measure type="value"><num>90.5 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K</measure></measure>).

These results are also summarized in Table I. The differences between these T c and ∆T c values and the ones corresponding to the where Q(σ) is the conductivity volume distribution. This expression may be recast into</p><p>Then, to the first order in (σ − σ eff )/σ eff the effective conductivity will be the volume-weighted average of the local conductivity. By assuming the presence of <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>types of domains, one with σ 1 = 1/ρ B + ∆σ and a superconducting volume fraction f , and other non superconducting with σ 2 = 1/ρ B and a volume fraction 1 − f it follows σ eff = f σ 1 + (1 − f )σ 2 . Then the effective paraconductivity would be given by ∆σ eff ≡ σ eff − σ B = f ∆σ i.e., it is also modulated in amplitude by f (a fact that could affect the τ rel value resulting from the comparison with the experimental data, see subsection 4.2). Therefore, the quantity −∆χ(ε) H /T ∆σ ab (ε) would be almost unaffected by a possible incomplete superconducting volume fraction. microbridge studied in the previous subsection are well within the dispersion expected for different high-quality OPT Y-123 samples. [8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36][37][38][39][40][41] The magnetic susceptibility rounding above T c , that following the conventional denomination will already be called precursor diamagnetism, is orders of magnitude smaller than in the Meissner region. [3,8] Therefore, to measure these roundings one must apply magnetic fields orders of magnitude larger than those used in the ZFC measurements. Figure 3(b) provides an example of these measurements, performed under a field amplitude of 1 T. To assure a complete temperature stabilization, data are taken after waiting ∼ <measure type="value"><num>5 </num><measure type="TIME" unit="minutes">minutes </measure></measure>since the temperature was within <measure type="value"><num>0.5</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">% </measure></measure>the target temperature. In the case of the isothermal curves, it is waited around <measure type="value"><num>5 </num><measure type="TIME" unit="minutes">minutes </measure></measure>after setting the magnetic field in permanent mode. In both cases, the measurements were performed with the reciprocating sample option (RSO), that performs sinusoidal oscillations of the sample about the centre of the detection system, and improves the resolution with respect to the conventional dc option.

The final resolution in magnetic moment was in the <measure type="value"><num>10 −8 </num></measure>emu range.</p><p><measure type="value"><num>Two </num></measure>aspects of these measurements deserve to be commented. First, as earlier stressed elsewhere, [68] the presence in our crystal of a relatively small amount on non-superconducting domains with large characteristic lengths (much larger than the superconducting coherence length amplitude) will, independently of their spatial distribution, just affect the amplitude of the magnetization rounding observed above T c , i.e., the precursor diamagnetism amplitude. Therefore, to simplify the analyses presented in the next sections (in particular when comparing with the paraconductivity) these possible effects will be neglected. When comparing with the GGL approaches, this approximation will in turn mainly affect the value of the amplitude of the upper critical field, but the corresponding uncertainties are expected to be comparable with those associated with the sample volume. Note also that the linear temperature dependence of the normal-state magnetic susceptibility observed well above T c in the inset of Fig. 3(b) further confirms the high quality of our crystal. These last data correspond to measurements under an applied magnetic field of 1 T but, as shown by the data in Fig. 4, this linearity remains for field amplitudes up to 5 T.</p><p>As shown in the precedent Section, well above T c and up to at least <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="250">250 </num></measure>K both the normal-state resistivity and the magnetic susceptibility depend linearly on temperature.</p><p>For each observable, one may define the onset temperature of the rounding effects above T c , denoted T onset , as the temperature below which the measured behavior separates from the one that may be extrapolated from the high temperature region. At the practical level, T onset may be determined as the temperature at which either dρ ab /dT or dχ/dT begin to rise above the extrapolated normal-state behavior beyond the noise level, as illustrated in Figs. 1(c) and 3(c). We have also defined a lower bound for T onset , denoted T low onset , as the temperature below which practically all the dχ/dT or dρ/dT data fall outside the extrapolated (normal-state) noise band. Under this criteria, we have found that T onset ≈ <measure type="interval"><num type="base">150 </num>± <num type="range">15 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>for both the paraconductivity and the precursor diamagnetism, the latter for µ 0 H = <measure type="value"><num>1 </num><measure type="MAGNETIC_INDUCTION" unit="T">T </measure></measure>(a field small enough to still correspond to the so-called <measure type="value"><num>zero </num></measure>field limit, see next Section).</p><p>We have checked that the T onset value determined from our resistivity measurements by using a background-independent procedure agrees, well within the corresponding experimental uncertainties, with those that may be inferred from the measurements of other research groups in the best available OPT Y-123 single-crystals and epitaxial films.

Let us further</p><p>The conductivity and the magnetization around T c in OPT Y-123... stress here that these results are independent not only of a specific model for the superconducting fluctuations but also of a background substraction.

It is also remarkable the universality of the T onset /T c ratio, which takes a value similar to the one found in other OPT HTSC and in conventional low-T c superconductors.

We have also checked that ∆σ ab (ε) remains stable when changing the critical temperature between T c and T c ± ∆T c . All these ∆σ ab (ε) uncertainties correspond to the shadowed region in Fig. 5(a) (that around T onset , i.e., ε ≈ <measure type="list"><num>0.55</num></measure>, covers the uncertainties estimated for T onset in the precedent subsection).</p><p>The ∆σ ab (ε) data of Fig. 5(a) agree at a quantitative level with most of the measurements published by different authors in OPT Y-123, [8, 11-24, <measure type="list"><num>38</num>, <num>48</num>, <num>49</num></measure>, 93-96] although in general these previous results may be not so accurate in the high-ε region. <measure type="value"><num>Two </num></measure>aspects make our new data of particular interest: First, they already provide a further but robust experimental demonstration, also model-independent, of the sharp fall-off of ∆σ ab (ε) when approaching T onset from below. Moreover, in contrast with other proposals, [95,97] our present results confirm that such a fall-off does not follow a power-law in reduced temperature. Second, these results may be confronted with the magnetoconductivity roundings measured in the same film and with the precursor diamagnetism measured in a single-crystal.

So, the results presented in Fig. 7(a) for ∆M(H) T were obtained by using as background the magnetization isotherm measured at <measure type="value"><num>135 </num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K</measure></measure>, which is relatively near T onset . A relevant aspect of these isotherms is their linear dependence on H in the so-called low field (or Schmidt, see next section) regime, defined by the condition H/H c2 (0) ≪ ε. This is further illustrated by the precursor diamagnetism data summarized in Figs. 7(b) and 7(c). One may conclude then that the ∆χ(ε, H) curve plotted in Fig. 5(b), measured under a field amplitude of 1 T, represents well the ε-dependence of the precursor diamagnetism in the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure>-field limit. This will allow the comparison, presented in the next subsection, with the paraconductivity, this last measured in absence of a magnetic field.</p><p>The ε-dependence of the ratio between the precursor diamagnetism in the <measure type="value"><num>zero </num></measure>field limit and the paraconductivity may be directly obtained from the results presented in Figs. 5(a) and <measure type="list"><num>5</num></measure>(b). The resulting data points are presented in Fig. 5(c), and they cover the ε-region between <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.02">0.02 </num>and <num atMost="0.4">0.4</num></measure>. Above this reduced temperature the results are no longer reliable, due to the combination of the uncertainties of each observable.</p><p>The ratio between ∆χ(ε) H and ∆σ ab (ε) has been earlier determined in Ref. [25] (only up to ε ≈ <measure type="value"><num>0.1</num></measure>) and Ref. [40] (in this case up to ε ≈ <measure type="value"><num>0.4</num></measure>). Our present data agree at a quantitative level with these earlier results up to ε ≈ <measure type="value"><num>0.1</num></measure>. However, the increase of the −∆χ/T ∆σ ab ratio for ε &gt; <measure type="interval"><num atLeast="0.1">0.1 </num></measure>proposed in Ref. [40] is not confirmed here, where the ε-independent behavior is observed up to the highest accessible reduced temperature. These differences may be attributed to the procedure used to determine the background The conductivity and the magnetization around T c in OPT Y-123...</p><p>It is useful to comment already here that on the grounds of the GGL scenario that is going to be detailed in the next Section, our present results on the ε-dependence of the −∆χ/T ∆σ ab ratio already provide direct, model-independent, information on the superconducting fluctuation effects on ∆σ ab (ε) and ∆χ(ε): In spite of their very different nature, both observables have, at a quantitative level, the same ε-behavior. This finding excludes possible contributions associated to their specific nature, like indirect fluctuation effects in the case of ∆σ ab (ε), or the presence of appreciable nonlocal electrodynamic effects in the case of ∆χ(ε) (see, e.g., Ref. [3]). The other central information in Fig. 5(c) is the value itself of the −∆χ/T ∆σ ab quotient, found to be ≃ <measure type="value"><num>3 × 10 −13 </num><measure type="?" unit="ΩmK −1">ΩmK −1 </measure></measure>. We will see in the next Section that, when combined, this double information provides a crucial experimental check for any theoretical proposal for both the paraconductivity and the precursor diamagnetism.</p><p>The experimental data summarized in the precedent Section will be first used to probe the T onset associated with the limits imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to the shrinkage of the superconducting coherence length when the temperature increases above T c . Then, most of this Section will be devoted to probe the meanfield Ginzburg-Landau scenario with superconducting fluctuations around the transition. This comparison will include the extended (with a total-energy cutoff, that takes into account the quantum localization) Gaussian-Ginzburg-Landau (GGL) approach for multilayered superconductors above T c and, consistently, the GL scaling in the lowestLandau-level (GL-LLL) approximation for 3D superconductors under finite applied magnetic fields in the critical region around T c (H). * Detailed descriptions of these theoretical results may be seen in the original works. [4-10, 36, <measure type="list"><num>41</num></measure>-43, 121, 122] An extension of the GGL calculations to the finite magnetic field regime will be summarized in Appendix A. Here we will just comment briefly on some aspects of the GL scenario that are still controversial, as the influence of the multilayering or the adequacy of the total-energy cutoff. * The relevance of other contributions to the in-plane paraconductivity and magnetoconductivity in Y-123 (Maki-Thomson, regular Maki-Thomson, and DOS, see Ref. [117]) were studied in detail in Ref. [118]. It was concluded that there is no consistent set of values for the parameters involved in these contributions that produce a simultaneous agreement with the experiments. Therefore, these contributions do not seem to give a good description of the effects of fluctuations in planar transport, regardless of whether they are useful or not to describe transport in the direction perpendicular to the planes, which is the purpose of the DOS effects, as initially proposed in Ref. [119]. For detailed measurements of the fluctuation conductivity normal to the ab layers see Ref. [120]. Other aspects are commented in subsection 5.1.</p><p>As earlier discussed in the pioneering work of Gollub and coworkers [123] (see also Refs. [3] and [8]), the mean-field GGL approaches are formally valid only in the ε-region ε LG ≤ ε ≪ 1, where ε LG is the so-called Levanyuk-Ginzburg reduced temperature. Since then, different attempts have been proposed to extend to high-ε these meanfield descriptions, including the introduction of different versions of the conventional momentum cutoff, [8-24, 49-65, 67, <measure type="list"><num>93</num></measure>-101, 124] or an ad hoc penalization (not a cutoff) of the short-wavelength fluctuation modes that already takes into account the quantum localization. [125,126] However, none of these earlier proposals lead to the vanishing of all fluctuation modes above a well-defined temperature, T onset . Such a T onset was proposed in Ref. [41] by just taking into account the limits imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle to the shrinkage, when the temperature increases above T c , of the superconducting coherence length, ξ(T ), that cannot be smaller than ξ T =<measure type="value"><num>0</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>, the actual coherence length at <measure type="value"><num>zero </num></measure>temperature first introduced by Pippard, [3,127] i.e.,</p><p>This condition directly leads to a well-defined T onset , given by ξ(T onset ) = ξ T =<measure type="value"><num>0</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>, above which all fluctuation modes vanish, independently of their wavelength. The corresponding cutoff reduced temperature is then just ε c ≡ ln(T onset /T c ). Note also that the above condition is indeed compatible with the existence of superconductivity in samples with sizes smaller than the value of ξ T =<measure type="value"><num>0</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>in the bulk. This is because, as earlier commented elsewhere (second paper in Ref. [41]), in such small superconductors the Pippard coherence length looses its conventional meaning (from a crude point of view, in these small superconductors the coherence length amplitude is also reduced with respect to the bulk value). As also stressed in Ref. [41], the above condition is general, and must apply to any theoretical description of the superconducting transition. Only the value of ε c will depend, through the temperature dependence of ξ(T ) and the relationship between ξ(T ) and ξ T =<measure type="value"><num>0</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>, of each particular approach. A relevant example will correspond to the combination of the mean-field temperature dependence of the coherence length, ξ(T ) = ξ(0)ε −1/2 [and then ε c = (ξ(0)/ξ T =<measure type="value"><num>0</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>) 2 ], with the relationship between ξ(T ) and ξ T =<measure type="value"><num>0</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>proposed by the mean-field BCS theory, which in the clean limit is ξ(0)= <measure type="value"><num>0.74</num></measure>ξ T =<measure type="value"><num>0</num><measure type="TEMPERATURE" unit="K">K </measure></measure>. [127] This leads then to ε c ≈<measure type="list"><num>0.55</num></measure>, i.e., T onset ≈<measure type="value"><num>1.7</num><measure type="?" unit="T c">T c </measure></measure>, in excellent agreement with our present experimental results for the onset of the resistivity and the magnetization roundings in the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure>-field limit presented in Figs. 1(c) and, respectively, 3(c), and summarized in Table I.</p><p>The conductivity and the magnetization around T c in OPT Y-<measure type="interval"><num atMost="123">123</num></measure>... The results summarized in Fig. 8 fully confirm this prediction. Other aspects of ε c will be commented in the next Section.</p><p>when analyzing the experimental data. Another relevant simplification concerns the effective distance, s, between adjacent superconducting ab-layers. As explained in detail in Refs. [7,8,72], in the GGL approach above T c in bilayered superconductors with <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>alternate interlayer distances s 1 and s 2 (such as Y-123) the effective s becomes equal to the bilayer periodicity s 1 +s 2 only if the corresponding Josephson interlayer couplings, γ 1 and γ 2 , differ among them by orders of magnitude, i.e., γ 1 /γ 2 → ∞. Instead, γ 1 /γ 2 &lt; ∼ <measure type="value"><num>30 </num></measure>in OPT Y-123, and in this case s = (s 1 + s 2 )/2 is an excellent approximation. [42,129].</p><p>Then, in what follows we will use s = (s 1 + s 2 )/2 as effective interlayer distance. The detailed analyses presented below will fully confirm the adequacy of these <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>starting simplifications.</p><p>Here τ rel ≡ τ 0 (0)/τ BCS 0 is the GL amplitude of the relaxation time of the fluctuating Cooper pairs for a wave vector k = <measure type="value"><num>0</num></measure>, expressed in adimensional units relative to the BCS amplitude τ BCS 0 = πh/(8k B T c ), [130] e is the electron charge,h is the reduced Planck constant, k B is the Boltzmann constant, φ 0 is the magnetic flux quantum, h ≡ H/H c2 (0) is the reduced magnetic field, w kz = B LD (1 − cos(k z s))/2 is the out-of-plane spectrum of the fluctuations, B LD = (2ξ c (0)/s) 2 is the so-called Lawrence-Doniach (LD) parameter, Γ, ψ and ψ (1) are the gamma, digamma and trigamma functions, and ξ c (0) and ξ ab (0) are the amplitudes of the transverse and in-plane GL coherence lengths. As indicated above, for the superconducting layers' periodicity length we will use s = (s 1 + s 2 )/2 = <measure type="value"><num>0.59 </num><measure type="LENGTH" unit="nm">nm</measure></measure>. In principle the total-energy cutoff constant, ε c , could be directly determined from the T onset obtained in the previous subsection. However, as a further check of consistency, here we will leave ε c free and we will compare the result with ln(T onset /T c ).</p><p>[3] The solid line in Fig. 5(c) corresponds to the best fit of Eq. 14 to the data, with ξ 2 ab (0)/τ rel as the only free parameter. This leads to ξ 2 ab (0)/τ rel ≃ <measure type="value"><num>1.1 </num><measure type="LENGTH" unit="nm">nm </measure></measure>2 a value that provides a relevant constraint to the remaining free parameters of the GGL scenario.</p><p>In order to disentangle the values of τ rel and ξ c (0), and also to determine the remaining free parameters entering the GGL expressions, i.e., ξ c (0) and ε c , we need to simultaneous and consistently fit Eqs. (8) to (11) to our full set of ∆σ ab (ε), ∆σ ab (ε, H), ∆χ(ε) and ∆M(ε, h) data.

In this figure, squares and circles represent the lower limit of applicability of the GL-LLL scalings of ∆M(T, H) and, respectively, ∆σ ab (T, H). The critical region boundary (dashed line) was evaluated by fitting to these data the behavior predicted by the so-called H-dependent Ginzburg criterion for 3D superconductors, [138]</p><p>Within the Gaussian region the dotted line represents the condition h ≈ <measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>ε, roughly separating the Prange regime from the low-H Schmidt regime. For completeness, we also indicate the experimental irreversibility line (triangles) obtained from the temperatures at which ρ ab (T ) H = <measure type="value"><num>0 </num></measure>[see Fig. 2(b)]. It is worth noting that direct application of Eq. (18) leads to a null width of the critical region in the limit H → 0. This arises from the failure at low fields of the LLL approximation used by Eq. (18). At H = <measure type="value"><num>0</num></measure>, the width of the full-critical region (where the mean-field-like approaches are no longer applicable and the superconducting fluctuations are described instead in terms of the XY model) may be approximated by the well-known Ginzburg criterion originally calculated for 3D superconductors by Levanyuk [139] and Ginzburg [140] (for an extension to layered superconductors, see Ref. [141]). The precise field-dependence of the critical region at low fields, and how it merges with the low-field full-critical region, is still unknown. Other still open issues concerning the full-critical region at <measure type="value"><num>zero </num></measure>field include the behavior of the fluctuation conductivity and magnetization: As already mentioned, the uncertainties in the determination of T c (and also the large effect of even a small T c distribution due to inhomogeneities, unavoidable in real samples) difficult determining the bare critical exponents in the very close vicinity of T c (H = <measure type="value"><num>0</num></measure>). In moderately anisotropic superconductors such as OPT Y-123, the 3D XY model is expected to provide a first approximation to the fluctuations in the full-critical region. But it could also be expected that the layered structure may induce extra fluctuation contributions arising from vortex-antivortex effects akin to those first proposed by Berezinskii [142] and by</p><p>The conductivity and the magnetization around T c in OPT Y-123... ≈ <measure type="value"><num>1.7</num><measure type="?" unit="T c">T c </measure></measure>). A detail around T c is presented in (c). Circles and squares are the limit of applicability of the GL-LLL scalings of ∆σ ab and, respectively, ∆M . The dashed line is a fit to the H-dependent Ginzburg criterion, Eq. 18. The solid line is the upper critical field given by Eq. 17. The dotted line in the Gaussian region corresponds to h ≈ <measure type="value"><num>0.2</num></measure>ε, and roughly separates the Prange regime and the low-H region (Schmidt regime).

[81,144,145], and for a measurement in the much more anisotropic La 2−x Sr x CuO 4 see Ref. [146]).

Further work will be clearly needed to fully understand these aspects.</p><p>In what concerns the CDW, as shown, e.g., in Ref. [148], their coexistence and mutual interaction with the superconducting order may be described in terms of <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>simultaneous order parameters, namely, the homogeneous superconducting order parameter associated with the superconducting gap and the periodic order parameter characteristic of the CDW-state. However, for the CDW to have a significant influence on the SC-state, several conditions are required. First of all, if the wave vector of the CDW differs significantly from 2k F , their influence on the stability of the Cooper pairs pairing becomes negligible. [148] Once this constrain is fulfilled, the possible effects of the CDW on the superconducting phase can be described by means of a modified Ginzburg-Landau functional that just differs from the conventional one by the presence of a coupling term between both order parameters. A rough estimate of the influence of the CDW on the superconductivity can be done through the first order correction of a perturbative treatment of such coupling term. For H ⊥ ab this results in a renormalization of the reduced temperature given by [149]</p><p>Here K is a coupling constant expected to be of the order of magnitude of T c /T CDW , and Q is the wavevector of the CDW. For OPT Y-123 Q ≈ <measure type="value"><num>0.3 </num></measure>(r.l.u.)≈ <measure type="value"><num>5 </num><measure type="?" unit="nm −1">nm −1 </measure></measure>, [104] and ξ ab (0) ≈ <measure type="value"><num>1 </num><measure type="LENGTH" unit="nm">nm</measure></measure>. Subsequently, the exponential in the above equation is negligible even for the highest reduced magnetic field used in our experiments (h ≈ <measure type="value"><num>0.15</num></measure>). This suggests the absence of appreciable effects of the CDW on the rounding observed in the range of temperatures and magnetic fields accessible in our experiments (see also the comments in the introduction of Section 4).</p><p>In what concerns the influence of the possible opening of a pseudogap on the measured rounding effects above T c , the most popular scenarios are those based on the existence of a region of phase disordering up to T * , the temperature where a pseudogap opens. [44,[46][47][48][49][50][51][52][53][54][55][56][57][58][59][60][61][62][63][64][65] These proposals are still at present a debated issue and, as noted before, in Refs. [69,[71][72][73] we have commented in some detail various aspects of their confrontation with the GGL scenarios. These previous comments include the role that could play in some measurements the presence of chemical inhomogeneities (see also, Ref. [70]). So, to complement these analyses, we will focus here on <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>particular but interesting points: i) First, the seemingly inaccessibility of the upper critical field line, H c2 (T ), that is in contrast with the case of conventional low-T c superconductors. In a Reply (see the second paper in Ref. [47]) to one of our Comments, [72] this behavior has been presented as a crucial new support of the phase fluctuation scenario (see also Ref. [86]). ii) Secondly, the implications of our present results indicating that superconducting fluctuations in OPT Y-123 are conventional, GL-type, and that fluctuating superconducting pairs do not exist above ∼ 2T c at OPT doping. The first point noted above was then the absence in the cuprates, in particular in OPT Y-123, of the characteristic changes in slope in the magnetization versus temperature curves that may be observed in low-T c superconductors when approaching the superconducting transition. In Ref. [47], these changes were claimed to be an universal fingerprint of the conventional (Ginzburg-Landau like) superconducting transitions at the H c2 (T ) line. However, the differences between high-T c cuprates and low-T c metallic superconductors may be easily attributed to the important differences between their superconducting parameter values, differences which, as is well known, lead already to a much important amplitudes of the own conventional, thermodynamic like, superconducting fluctuations (fluctuations of both the phase and the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter). A direct consequence is that the critical region around the H c2 (T ) line (where the GGL approximation is no longer valid) is much wider in high-T c cuprates. In fact, these differences were earlier accounted for in Ref. [6] as a consequence of the differences between the superconducting parameter values: By using a self-consistent Hartree approximation to treat the quartic term in the Lawrence-Doniach free energy functional, these authors showed that, in contrast with the low-T c superconductors, in the cuprate superconductors the transport and thermodynamic observables must interpolate smoothly through the H c2 (T ) line (see also Ref. [101]).</p><p>We comment now on the second point indicated above, the implications of our results on the much debated issue of the so-called pseudogap line of the temperaturedoping phase diagram of HTS. First of all, we have to note that various criteria have been suggested for the determination of the pseudogap temperature T * , leading to significantly different results for OPT doping. In particular, some authors (see, e.g., Refs. [52,102,103,105] and references therein) suggest that the pseudogap temperature would lie well below T c in OPT Y-123, while other authors (see, e.g., Refs. [1,2,<measure type="list"><num>47</num>,<num>60</num>,<num>66</num></measure>,86,150]) locate T * in OPT Y-123 well above T c (near <measure type="value"><num>1.7</num><measure type="?" unit="T c">T c</measure></measure>,OPT , i.e., close to our T onset ).</p><p>Concerning the second scenario (T * &gt; T c for OPT doping), our present results provide an interesting thermodynamic constraint for the corresponding explanations of the pseudogap. In particular, our results (like, importantly, the constant ratio −∆χ/T ∆σ ab , the accordance of T onset with the value <measure type="value"><num>1.7</num><measure type="?" unit="T c">T c </measure></measure>, or the excellent agreement of ∆σ(ε), ∆σ(ε, H), ∆χ(ε) and ∆M(ε, H) with the quantitative predictions of the GGL and GL-LLL equations) provide compelling evidence that, in OPT Y-123, the roundings above the transition are already accounted for by fluctuations conventional for both the phase and the amplitude of the superconducting order parameter. This strongly suggests that any uncoventional fluctuation scenario for underdoped cuprates should evolve as doping approaches the OPT level, in particular recovering a conventional GGL fluctuation behaviour at OPT doping. Fluctuation-pseudogap theories should be, therefore, worked out to introduce this new constraint. In fact, this has been done in part in works such as Refs. [151][152][153] that include variations of strong phase fluctuation theories for the pseudogap that have the capability to recover GGL-type fluctuations in the OPT doping limit.</p><p>Let us also briefly dicuss on an additional difficulty affecting the conclusions of some authors that define the pseudogap temperature as the temperature onset for the resistivity rounding above T c (see, e.g., Ref. [66] and references therein). As is well known, the application of such a criterion is a hazardous task when the in plane resistivity rounding onset manifests, as it is the case of the OPT Y-123, between T c and 2T c , because of the unavoidable presence of appreciable superconducting fluctuation effects in this temperature region. In fact, under this criterion, T * in OPT Y-123 will coincide also with the temperature onset of the rounding effects above T c in other observables, including the magnetization and the Nernst coefficient. An illustrative example for this last observable may be seen in Fig. 2 of Ref. [66]. By comparing the interesting and precise experimental results presented there with those summarized in Fig. 3 of our present paper, one may see that the proposed T * also agrees with the temperature onset of the rounding effects in the measured magnetization above T c . In fact, as the excellent measurements summarized in Ref. [66] were performed in detwinned crystals, it could be useful to note here that the rounding behavior observed in earlier resistivity measurements, performed also in a detwinned OPT Y-123 crystal, were explained at a quantitative level in terms of the GGL approach for conventional superconducting fluctuations. [12] By introducing a total energy cutoff, in our present paper we have extended such an agreement up to the own temperature onset of the measured roundings. Let us further stress that the comments on the T * location presented above just concerns the OPT Y-123 superconductor. What origin could have these discrepancies? Contrarily to the entangled difficulties that, as we have briefly commented in the Introduction of our present paper, may arise when analyzing the rounding effects on the in-plane resistivity above T c in overdoped or underdoped compounds and also in other observables, in this case the answer seems quite direct: The main argument proposed in Ref. [66] (and also by other authors; see, e.g., Ref. [50] and our comments therein) to discard the conventional superconducting fluctuations as the physical origin of the rounding effects they measure above T c , in particular in the resistivity, is based on the questionable hypothesis that these conventional fluctuations may be quenched by relatively low reduced magnetic fields, h = H/H c2 (0). † † However, such a criterion is questionable because the field amplitudes used in these measurements are not important enough as to quench the conventional superconducting fluctuations above T c . For instance, in the case of the OPT Y-123 even the highest field amplitudes used correspond to reduced fields well below <measure type="interval"><num atMost="0.1">0.1 </num></measure>which, as one may easily check by using any version of the GGL approach, [3] is too small to efficiently diminish the Gaussian fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter. In fact, one could arrive to this conclusion by just taking a look to direct experimental results obtained under much larger reduced † † An illustrative example may be seen in Ref. [66], where such an hypothesis was explicitly used to separate between <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>different contributions to the negative Nernst coefficient measured above T c : <measure type="value"><num>One </num></measure>contribution, only observable just near T c and "strongly field-dependent", which these authors attribute to superconducting fluctuations; and a second contribution, magnetic field-independent, which extends up to the onset of the negative Nernst effect and attributed to quasiparticles in the pseudogap phase.</p><p>As the onset of the negative Nernst coefficient measured above T c in cuprate superconductors was related to a pseudogap by different research groups (see, e.g., Ref. [66]), and taking also into account the importance, stressed above, of the precise localization of T * in the OPT Y-123 superconductor, it could also be useful to briefly comment here on this aspect. Note first that the own nature of this anomalous Nernst effect is still at present a debated issue. [1,<measure type="list"><num>55</num>,<num>80</num>,<num>100</num></measure>,153] In fact, the discrepancies manifest already in the procedures proposed to separate the superconducting effects from the normal state (background) behavior: Well above T c , some authors attribute the decrease of the Nernst coefficient, often observed in different cuprate superconductors, to the normal state behavior. Then, the superconducting effects are extracted by using a baseline background that eliminates that decrease. This procedure was used by different authors, [150,154] and it is illustrated, for instance, in Fig. 3 of the early paper of Xu and coworkers. [150] In contrast, other authors obtain the background of the Nernst coefficient by extrapolating up to T c its normal state behavior at high reduced temperatures. Such a procedure may be appreciated in Fig. 1 of the first paper of Ref. [66], where the corresponding Nernst effect was attributed to quasiparticles in the pseudogap region.</p><p>The discrepancies and shortcomings when analyzing the thermomagnetic effects above T c in cuprate superconductors are to some extent similar to those already encountered, many years ago, in the case of the low-T c superconductors (see, e.g., Refs. [155][156][157][158]): There was a large consensus in attributing the origin of the thermomagnetic effects observed below T c to the movement of magnetic vortices and to its corresponding entropy flux. This consensus extends also to a similar origin of these effects, also below T c , in the cuprate superconductors, as already stressed when analyzing earlier measurements in the cuprates (see, e.g., Refs. [47,159], and references therein). In contrast, also in low-T c superconductors there was not consensus on the origin of the thermomagnetic effects observed above T c , the mechanisms proposed being as different as surface superconductivity, conventional superconducting fluctuations or normal state effects. [155][156][157][158] These discrepancies remain until now, but they do not have prevented a large consensus when attributing to conventional superconducting fluctuations the measured resistivity and magnetization rounding effects. [3] A particularly illustrative example of this situation is provided by the results obtained in Pb-In alloys: Early detailed measurements of the Ettingshausen effect show an appreciable signal up to <measure type="interval"><num atMost="1.25">1.25</num></measure>H c2 (0), whose origin is not yet well settled [158]. In contrast, the rounding effects on the magnetization measured in these alloys extend only up 1.1H c2 (0), this last result being in excellent agreement with the GGL approach under a total energy cutoff for the conventional superconducting fluctuations. [112,160]</p><p>The rounding effects on the electrical conductivity and on the magnetization have been measured on both sides of the critical transition temperature, T c , in a high-quality single-crystal and in a thin film of the prototypical optimally-doped YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7−δ high-T c superconductor, including the high reduced-temperature region above T c and the low and moderate magnetic field regimes. An aspect particularly remarkable of our present measurements is that the high chemical and structural quality of our samples has considerably reduced the ambiguities associated with the corresponding T c -inhomogeneities. In addition, the comparison between both observables provides an useful consistency check. The direct experimental information, model and background independent, provided by our measurements includes the temperature location of the rounding onset above T c , that is found to be T onset /T c = <measure type="interval"><num type="base">1.7 </num>± <num type="range">0.2 </num></measure>for all the studied observables. When analyzing in the fourth part of our paper these measurements in terms of the GL scenario with superconducting fluctuations, the comparisons between the roundings of the resistivity and of the magnetization in the <measure type="value"><num>zero </num></measure>field limit provide an experimental demonstration of the absence of indirect fluctuation effects on the paraconductivity (in particular, Maki-Thomson or DOS effects), and of nonlocal electrodynamic effects on the precursor diamagnetism, even in the high reducedtemperature region.</p><p>The analyses of the high quality experimental data summarized here in terms of the GL scenario include the extended (with a total-energy cutoff) Gaussian-GinzburgLandau (GGL) approach for multilayered superconductors above T c and, consistently, the GL-lowest-Landau-level (GL-LLL) scaling for 3D superconductors in the critical region around T c (H). Our results confirm at a quantitative level the adequacy of these phenomenological descriptions, and they strongly suggest that the possible presence of other, unconventional, mechanisms do not appreciably affect the rounding of the different observables above T c in OPT Y-123. These analyses contribute to clarify <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>central aspects, still open and debated until now, of the GGL scenario: They support at a quantitative level that the effective interlayer distance in this multilayered superconductor may be approximated as one half of the crystallographic periodicity length, as proposed in Ref. [7] by studying at a theoretical level the GGL approach for multilayered superconductors; and they show the adequacy of the so-called total energy cutoff, that takes into account the Heisenberg quantum localization energy associated with the shrinkage of the superconducting wave function when the temperature increases well above T c . This total-energy cutoff not only accounts for the observed rounding onset temperatures but also explains at a quantitative level the behavior of these roundings below their onsets, in the so-called high reduced-temperature region for the superconducting fluctuations.</p><p>Finally, we have also briefly commented on some existing proposals to explain these rounding effects in terms of <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>unconventional (non-GL) scenarios: the charge density waves and the presence of a pseudogap. We conclude that, in the case of OPT Y-123, at present the experiments do not unambiguously support that these effects are the origin of the rounding above T c . On the contrary, the results summarized in our present paper, in particular in the high reduced-temperature region, support that the measured roundings are originated by the presence of conventional fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter, well described by the Gaussian-Ginzburg-Landau approaches. As we have stressed above, these conclusions directly concern some of the proposals for the pairing mechanisms in cuprates. Moreover, the interest of our present results, in particular the extensions of the theoretical GGL scenario to high reduced temperatures, is also enhanced by their usefulness in future analyses at a quantitative level of the rounding effects around T c in underdoped and overdoped samples. However, as also stressed above, the unavoidable presence of chemical inhomogeneities [37,67,73], that lead to important inhomogeneities of T c , and also the possible entanglement with the effects associated with the opening of a pseudogap well above the measured T c , will add further difficulties when performing these analyses. In turn, these last conclusions further enhance the relevance of the prototypical OPT Y-123 to probe the phenomenological descriptions of the superconducting transition in cuprates.</p><p>This work was supported by project FIS2016-79109-P (AEI/FEDER, UE), and the Xunta de Galicia (projects GPC2014/038 and AGRUP 2015/11).

Recently [161] the fluctuation-induced conductivity and magnetoconductivity have been calculated in the finite magnetic field regime in 3D superconductors by combining the standard GL expression for the thermal-averaged current density of the superconducting condensate with the generalized Langevin equation of the order parameter, taking into account a total-energy cutoff to include the short-wavelength effects expected to be important when ε &gt; ∼ <measure type="value"><num>0.1</num></measure>. [161] This procedure is similar to the one earlier proposed by A. Schmid in his pioneering calculations in the <measure type="value"><num>zero </num></measure>field limit and without cutoff. [122] Here, we briefly summarize a similar extension of these calculations to the 2D and the layered scenarios.</p><p>We first consider the 2D case, i.e., a superconductor with thickness d in the perpendicular (or z-) direction much smaller than the superconducting coherence length amplitude in that direction [i.e., d ≪ ξ c (0)]. Under this condition the spectrum of the fluctuations appearing in the formalism of Ref. [161] in absence of cutoff. In the <measure type="value"><num>zero </num></measure>field limit (i.e. for h ≪ ε, ε c ), from Eq. A.1 it results that the paraconductivity with a total-energy cutoff in a 2D superconductor is ∆σ 2D (ε, ε c ) = e 2 16hd 1 ε − 1 ε c , (A. 3) that in absence of cutoff leads to the well-known Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) expression for ∆σ in a 2D superconductor [162] ∆σ 2D (ε) = e 2 16hdε . (A.4)</p><p>Let us note here that, as done in the classical paper by Hikami and Larkin [114] for the low-ε, no-cutoff case, we could expand Eqs. A.1 and (A.2) in powers of h up to quadratic order. Our Eq. A.2 would then produce for ∆σ an extra prefactor 2/3 with respect to the result in Ref. [114], which origin may be traced back to a different use of the Langevin equation for the order parameter in both calculations. (This prefactor difference exist also in the layered case, presented later in this Appendix). It does not seem feasible in practice to determine what use of the Langevin equation produces better accordance with experiments at low fields, given that the prefactor may be compensated with a change of only ∼ <measure type="value"><num>10</num><measure type="FRACTION" unit="%">% </measure></measure>in the value of ξ ab (0) [because h ∝ ξ 2 ab (0)] and this is below the uncertainty in any determination of the experimental value of ξ ab (0). However, direct introduction of the cutoff in the formalism of Ref. [114] leads to some unphysical inconsistencies in the resulting equations; we favor, therefore, our present formalism when analyzing the data including the ε &gt; ∼ <measure type="value"><num>0.1 </num></measure>region. We now summarize here the extension of these results to layered superconductors. [163] We shall consider here only layered superconductors with a single interlayer distance, s. For that, we first adapt Eq. (B.18) of Ref. [161] (giving the fluctuationinduced conductivity in 3D as a sum over the contributions of different Landau levels) to the layered case by introducing the appropriate out-of-plane spectrum of the fluctuations [114] This last being the well-known AL-like expression for the paraconductivity in the LDscenario. [131] As already commented in detail for the 3D case in Ref. [161], the high-ε behaviour of the <measure type="value"><num>zero</num></measure>-field paraconductivity produced by our present formalism is slightly different from our previous results for ∆σ ab (ε, ε c ) in Ref. [38]. These small differences are only quantitative, not qualitative: In both cases it is predicted a rapid falloff of the fluctuation-induced effects above ε ≃ <measure type="value"><num>0.1</num></measure>, and a vanishing of these fluctuations at ε = ε c . In fact, in our present analysis these differences could be absorbed by a small change in the ε c value. † Previous calculations of different fluctuation-induced observables under a total energy cutoff in layered superconductors were obtained from the corresponding 2D results by applying the substitution ε → ε+ω LD kz even to the maximum Landau level index, that leads to n max = ε c −ε−ω kz 2h −1. [38][39][40] In the 3D limit ω LD kz → ω 3D kz and the condition on n max is somehow equivalent to cut the k-space considering only the fluctuating modes inside a sphere. However, to be consistent with our own 3D calculations of ∆σ(ε, h) and of other fluctuation-induced observables (see Ref. [161] and references therein), we have performed the total energy cutoff in the form of a finite cylinder, that leads to n max = ε c −ε 2h − 1. The difference between the <measure type="value"><num>two </num></measure>ways to apply the total energy cutoff in the LD-scenario lead to small quantitative differences that can be absorbed by a small change in the cutoff amplitude in materials where B LD ≪ ε c , as it is the case of OPT Y-123.</p></text></tei>
