URhSi is isostructural to uranium ferromagnetic superconductors URhGe and UCoGe. The critical exponent β for the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization below TC, γ for the magnetic susceptibility, and δ for the magnetic isotherm at TC in URhSi have been determined as <quantifiedObject id="63c571f9-88a5-4831-a73e-99222840b55a">β </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="interval" ptr="#63c571f9-88a5-4831-a73e-99222840b55a">0.300 ± 0.002</measure>, <quantifiedObject id="89690c1e-5db0-4f20-8393-2a48c5c4fe64">γ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="interval" ptr="#89690c1e-5db0-4f20-8393-2a48c5c4fe64">1.00 ± 0.02</measure>, and <quantifiedObject id="a9783e38-15c7-443d-b077-0a615ecef96b">δ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="interval" ptr="#a9783e38-15c7-443d-b077-0a615ecef96b">4.38 ± 0.04 </measure>by the scaling analysis and the critical isotherm analysis. These critical exponents fulfill the Widom scaling law δ = <measure type="value">1 </measure>+ γ/β. Magnetization has strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in the ferromagnetic state of URhSi. However, the universality class of the ferromagnetic transition does not belong to the 3D Ising system with short-range exchange interactions between magnetic moments (<quantifiedObject id="956c1346-6fe2-4648-87f2-530b58ade04b">β </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#956c1346-6fe2-4648-87f2-530b58ade04b">0.325</measure>, <quantifiedObject id="e335f5fd-ad91-4b9a-8493-df5dab9b1835">γ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#e335f5fd-ad91-4b9a-8493-df5dab9b1835">1.241</measure>, and <quantifiedObject id="88f6f38a-0b04-44e0-9192-3e1a7785954d">δ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#88f6f38a-0b04-44e0-9192-3e1a7785954d">4.82</measure>). The obtained exponents in URhSi are similar to those in the uranium ferromagnetic superconductors UGe2 and URhGe, and uranium ferromagnets UIr and U(Co<measure type="value">0.98</measure>Os<measure type="value">0.02</measure>)Al. We have previously reported the unconventional critical behavior of magnetization in the uranium ferromagnetic superconductors [N. Tateiwa et al. Phys. Rev. B 89, 064420 (2014)]. The universality class of the ferromagnetic transition in URhSi may belong to the same one in the uranium ferromagnetic superconductors and the uranium ferromagnets. The unconventional critical behavior of the magnetization in the uranium compounds cannot be understood with previous theoretical interpretations of critical phenomena. The absence of the superconductivity in URhSi is discussed from several viewpoints. The improvement of the sample quality in URhSi could provide a good opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the ferromagnetic superconductivity in the uranium ferromagnets.</p><p>In this paper, we report the novel critical behavior of the magnetization in URhSi. The compound crystalizes in the same orthorhombic TiNiSi-type crystal structure (space group P nma) to those of the uranium ferromagnetic superconductors URhGe and UCoGe [19]. URhSi shows a ferromagnetic transition at the Curie temperature T C ∼ <measure type="value">10 K</measure>. The superconductivity has not been observed down to <measure type="value">40 mK </measure>[20]. The ferromagnetic state in URhSi has uniaxial magnetic anisotropy with the mag-netic easy axis parallel to the c axis in the orthorhombic crystal structure [20], which is similar to the uranium ferromagnetic superconductors URhGe [15] and UCoGe [16]. We find that the universality class of the critical phenomenon in URhSi does not belong to the 3D Ising model. The values of the critical exponents in URhSi are similar to those in URhGe and UGe 2 . The universality class of the ferromagnetic transition in URhSi may belong to the same one in URhGe and UGe 2 . We discuss the static and dynamical magnetic properties of URhSi in comparison with those of URhGe, UCoGe, and UGe 2 . Possible reasons for the absence of the superconductivity in URhSi are discussed.</p><p>We summarize the crystal structure and basic physical properties of URhSi in this subsection. Figure 1 shows the orthorhombic TiNiSi-type crystal structure and Table I shows the structural parameters of URhSi. Here, B eq is the equivalent isotropic atomic displacement parameter. Lattice parameters at room temperature are determined as <quantifiedObject id="b536fb6c-1dea-44cb-9007-0e63d74aef21">a </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#b536fb6c-1dea-44cb-9007-0e63d74aef21">0.69970</measure>(4) nm, <quantifiedObject id="d5f920a9-e7c7-4754-bd1f-a714e2442b26">b </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#d5f920a9-e7c7-4754-bd1f-a714e2442b26">0.42109</measure>(2) nm, and <quantifiedObject id="1a975f57-b7ea-41cc-919c-b06a2a75c98b">c </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#1a975f57-b7ea-41cc-919c-b06a2a75c98b">0.74458</measure>(4) nm by single-crystal x-ray diffraction techniques using an imaging plate area detector (Rigaku) with Mo Kα radiation. The distances between the uranium atoms are d 1 = <measure type="value">0.3638 nm </measure>and <quantifiedObject id="8e524532-de20-4052-b618-e2fed7298f77">d 2 </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#8e524532-de20-4052-b618-e2fed7298f77">0.3408 nm </measure>along the a and b axes, respectively. The structure can be regarded as coupled chains of the nearest-neighbor uranium atoms ("zigzag chain") running along the crystallographic b axis. Meanwhile, the distance d 1 is shorter than d 2 in URhGe and UCoGe [3]. The crystal structure of both compounds can be viewed as the coupled zigzag chains along the a axis. Table II tabulates the values of T C , p eff , p s , T 0 , T A , and T C /T 0 for URhSi, URhGe, UCoGe, and UGe 2 . Here, p eff and p s are the effective and the spontaneous magnetic moments, respectively. The definitions of T 0 and T A will be explained later. The values of the parameters for URhSi are determined in this study. UGe 2 orders ferromagnetically at the relatively high Curie temperature <quantifiedObject id="e6fa8887-68c6-4a24-8f54-d814a3ccaa58">T C </quantifiedObject>of <measure type="value" ptr="#e6fa8887-68c6-4a24-8f54-d814a3ccaa58">52.6 K </measure>with the large spontaneous magnetic moment p <quantifiedObject id="4b5c9930-5e93-42fa-9ddf-29db0b8a2b1c">s </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#4b5c9930-5e93-42fa-9ddf-29db0b8a2b1c">1.41 µ </measure>B /U [18]. Meanwhile, UCoGe shows the ferromagnetic transition at <quantifiedObject id="f61feffe-e7d1-4b6e-8497-1240cbd4ff0a">T C </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#f61feffe-e7d1-4b6e-8497-1240cbd4ff0a">2.4 K </measure>with the small spontaneous magnetic moment p <quantifiedObject id="c92eb5ce-6e02-437d-af8f-425021202779">s </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#c92eb5ce-6e02-437d-af8f-425021202779">0.0039 µ </measure>B /U [7]. The values of T C and p s in URhSi are similar to those in URhGe [18]. Neutron diffraction studies on URhSi have shown a collinear ferromagnetic structure with an uranium magnetic moment of <measure type="interval">0.50 -0.55 µ </measure>B /U oriented along the c axis [21,22]. The ferromagnetic structure is the same as those in URhGe and UCoGe [6,23]. The linear specific heat coefficient γ in URhSi was determined as <quantifiedObject id="5d8c3374-8c2a-4f6e-b87a-c5d43f8f2edb">γ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#5d8c3374-8c2a-4f6e-b87a-c5d43f8f2edb">164.2 mJ</measure>/(mol·K 2 ) in the ferromagnetic ordered state [20]. This value is almost the same as that [∼ <measure type="value">160 mJ</measure>/(mol·K 2 )] in URhGe estimated from the C/T value just above the superconducting transition temperature T sc [24]. The γ value in UCoGe [= <measure type="value">57 mJ</measure>/(mol·K 2 )] is about one-third of those in URhSi and UCoGe [7]. There are several similarities in the basic physical properties between URhSi and UCoGe. Next, we compare the dynamical magnetic property in URhSi with those in the uranium ferromagnetic superconductors UGe 2 , URhGe, and UCoGe. Recently, we have studied the applicability of Takahashi's spin fluctuation theory to the actinide 5f systems [25][26][27][28]. We analyzed the magnetic data of <measure type="value">80 </measure>actinide ferromagnets and determined spin fluctuation parameters T 0 and T A : the widths of the spin fluctuation spectrum in the energy and</p><p>Generalized Rhodes-Wohlfarth plot for uranium, neptunium and plutonium ferromagnets, and the 3d metals and their intermetallic ferromagnetic compounds shown as closed circles, squares, triangles and anti-triangles, respectively [25]. The data for UCoGe and the 3d systems are cited from the literature [26][27][28][29][30][31][32]. Solid line shows a theoretical relation between TC/T0 and p eff /ps in the Takahashi's spin fluctuation theory [26][27][28]. [18,25], UCoGe [7,29] and UGe2 [18,25]. Figure 2 shows the plot of p eff /p s and T C /T 0 (the generalized Rhodes-Wohlfarth plot) for the actinide ferromagnets, and the 3d metals and their intermetallic ferromagnetic compounds [25]. The data for uranium, neptunium, and plutonium compounds, and the 3d systems are plotted as closed circles, squares, triangles, and anti-triangles, respectively. The data for URhSi, URhGe, UCoGe, and UGe 2 are highlighted. A solid line represents a theoretical relation between T C /T 0 and p eff /p s in the Takahashi's spin fluctuation theory. The data for UCoGe and the 3d systems are cited from the literature [26][27][28][29][30][31][32]. The parameters of the other actinide compounds were determined by us [25]. The data of the actinide ferromagnets follow the theoretical relation for T C /T 0 &lt; <measure type="interval">1.0</measure>. This suggests the applicability of the theory to most of the actinide ferromagnets. Several data points deviate from the relation near T C /T 0 = <measure type="value">1</measure>, which may be due to some effects arising from the localized character of the 5f electrons not included in the theory. In the spin fluctuation theory, the degree of the itinerancy of magnetic electrons can be discussed from the parameter T C /T 0 [26][27][28]. The strong itinerant character of the magnetic electrons is suggested at T C /T 0 ≪ 1 and a relation T C /T 0 = <measure type="value">1 </measure>indicates the local moment ferromagnetism. The value of <quantifiedObject id="0a1bcc7b-774e-484c-9b0b-0c3bb5caabd1">T C </quantifiedObject>/T 0 = <measure type="value" ptr="#0a1bcc7b-774e-484c-9b0b-0c3bb5caabd1">0.571 </measure>for UGe 2 suggests that it is located comparably close to the local moment system. Meanwhile, the small values of</p><p>We show the temperature dependencies of the magnetic susceptibility χ and its inverse 1/χ in a <quantifiedObject id="a709b9c3-ae21-4fd2-af0d-55b8a3819f84">magnetic field </quantifiedObject>of <measure type="value" ptr="#a709b9c3-ae21-4fd2-af0d-55b8a3819f84">0.1 T </measure>applied along the magnetic easy c axis of URhSi in Fig. 3(a). The magnetic susceptibility χ was analyzed using a modified Curie-Weiss law χ = C/(T − θ) + χ 0 shown as solid line. Here, C and θ are the Curie constant and the paramagnetic Curie temperature, respectively. χ 0 is the temperature-independent component of the magnetic susceptibility from the density of states at the Fermi energy from other than the 5f electrons. The effective magnetic moment p eff is determined as p eff = <measure type="value">2.94 µ </measure>B /U per uranium atom from C = N A µ 2 B p 2 eff /3k B . Here, N A is the Avogadro constant. The smaller value of p eff than those expected for 5f 2 (U 4+ , p eff = <measure type="value">3.58 µ B /U</measure>) and 5f 3 (U 3+ , p eff = <measure type="value">3.62 µ B /U</measure>) configurations suggests the itinerant character of the 5f electrons in URhSi. We show the magnetic field dependencies of the magnetization at several temperatures in magnetic field applied along the magnetic easy c axis of URhSi in Fig. 3 (b). The spontaneous magnetic moment p s is determined as p <quantifiedObject id="53d0a551-772d-4d23-9efb-4e8980e36618">s </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#53d0a551-772d-4d23-9efb-4e8980e36618">0.571 µ B /U </measure>from the magnetization curve at <measure type="value">2.0 K</measure>.

The reason for this discrepancy is not clear. The magnetization curves in fields along the magnetic hard a and b axes at <measure type="value">2.0 K </measure>are also shown in Fig. 3 (b). Clearly, the ferromagnetic ordered state has large magnetic anisotropy, similar to those in the uranium ferromagnetic superconductors UGe 2 , URhGe, and UCoGe [14][15][16]. This uniaxial magnetic anisotropy is consistent with the collinear ferromagnetic structure with the uranium magnetic moments oriented along the c axis determined in the neutron scattering studies [21,22]. There are differences in the magnetization curves between the present and the previous studies [20,22]. In the previous studies, the value of p s is less than <measure type="interval">0.5 µ </measure>B /U in the magnetization curve along the c axis and the spontaneous magnetic moment above <measure type="value">0.1 µ </measure>B /U occurs in magnetic fields applied along the magnetic hard a and b axes. The magnetization along the a axis is slightly larger than that along the b axis at <measure type="value">2.0 K </measure>[20,22]. These features are not consistent with the present data shown in Fig. 3 (b). The magnetization curves in the previous studies suggest the tilt of the magnetic moment from the c axis to the a-b plane. However, this is inconsistent with the simple ferromagnetic structure with the magnetic moments aligned along the c axis determined by the neutron scattering experiments [21,22]. The authors of <measure type="value">Ref. 22 </measure>proposed several possible reasons for this discrepancy such as the existence of grains in their single-crystal sample. It seems that a final conclusion has not been made. We stress that the magnetization curves in Fig. 3 (b) are consistent with the magnetic structure determined in the neutron scattering studies [21,22].</p><p>The following equation of state is derived from the equilibrium condition by minimizing the free energy ∂F (M )/∂M = <measure type="value">0</measure>:</p><p>FIG .

However, the obtained critical exponents in URhSi are different from those of the 3D Heisenberg (d = <measure type="value">3</measure>, n =<measure type="value">3</measure>), 3D XY (d = <measure type="value">3</measure>, n =<measure type="value">2</measure>), 3D Ising (d = <measure type="value">3</measure>, n =<measure type="value">1</measure>), and 2D Ising (d = <measure type="value">2</measure>, n =<measure type="value">1</measure>) models where magnetic moments are interacted via short-range (SR) exchange interactions of a form J(r) ∼ e −r/b . Here, b is the correlation length. The value of <quantifiedObject id="fda3fb1f-5514-4afc-bd3d-24f95cdd19f2">β </quantifiedObject>in URhSi is close to those in the 3D models but the γ value is close to unity, expected one in the mean-field theory. While the magnetization M s shows the critical behavior around T C , the magnetic [17,40,41] with those in URhSi, uranium ferromagnetic superconductors UGe2 [18], URhGe [18] and UCoGe [7], and uranium ferromagnets UIr [42] and U(Co<measure type="value" ptr="#fda3fb1f-5514-4afc-bd3d-24f95cdd19f2">0.98</measure>Os<measure type="value">0.02</measure>)Al [44].

The universality class of the ferromagnetic transition in URhSi may not belong to any known universality class. The obtained critical exponents in URhSi are similar to those in UGe 2 , URhGe, UIr, and U(Co <measure type="value">0.98 </measure>Os <measure type="value">0.02 </measure>)Al where the ferromagnetic state has strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. The universality class of the ferromagnetic transitions in URhSi may belong to the same one of the uranium ferromagnets. Note that we previously reported the unconventional critical scaling of magnetization in UGe 2 and URhGe [18]. The values of the exponent β slightly differ, depending on each ferromagnet. Meanwhile, the γ values of the uranium ferromagnets are close to unity. This almost mean-field behavior of the magnetic susceptibility χ may be a characteristic feature of the unconventional critical behavior of the magnetization in the uranium ferromagnets. The ferromagnetic correlation in the uranium ferromagnets may be different from that in the 3D Ising system. This unusual critical behavior of the magnetization may be inherent in the ferromagnetism of 5f electrons where the superconductivity could appear.</p><p>Here, ∆C is the jump of the specific heat at T C and ξ 0 is the correlation length ξ (1/ξ 2 = <measure type="value">1</measure>/ξ 2 0 |1 − T /T C |) at 2T C . It is possible to estimate the temperature region where the mean-field theory fails by the Ginzburg criterion. Previously, we determined the value of ∆T G as ∼ <measure type="value">100 K </measure>for UGe 2 in Ref. 18 using the neutron scattering and specific heat data [5,48] and concluded that the data used for the determination of the critical exponents in UGe 2 were collected inside the asymptotic critical region. The large value of ∆T G may be due to experimental errors in the values of ∆C and ξ 0 . ∆T G is very sensitive to ξ 0 . Unfortunately, it is impossible to estimate ∆T G for URhSi since there has been no report for the correlation length ξ 0 . The critical exponents in URhSi are determined using the data in the temperature region from <measure type="value">9.0 K </measure>to <measure type="value">11.0 K </measure>(<measure type="value">0 </measure>&lt; t &lt; <measure type="interval">0.1</measure>). The present analyses suggest that this temperature region is inside the asymptotic critical region. The T -linear dependence of the magnetic susceptibility χ −1 does not indicate that the analysis is done using the data taken outside the asymptotic critical region. We also rule out the possibility of the strongly asymmetric critical region or the change of the universality class across T C as mentioned before.</p><p>The mean-field behavior of the magnetization in UCoGe is briefly discussed [7]. As shown in Table II, the values of the spontaneous magnetic moment (p <quantifiedObject id="08681844-3a8c-479d-b878-f4f66333787f">s </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#08681844-3a8c-479d-b878-f4f66333787f">0.039 µ B /U</measure>) and the parameter T C /T 0 ( = <measure type="value">0.0065</measure>) are very small compared with those in UGe 2 and URhGe. These results suggest the strong itinerant characters of the 5f electrons. We previously estimated the value of ∆T G as less than <measure type="interval">1 mK </measure>using the specific heat and the neutron data [7,18,49]. This value suggests a very narrow asymptotic critical region. The strong itinerant character of the 5f electrons masks the critical behavior in UCoGe. The mean-field behavior of the magnetization is expected to appear since most of the magnetic data around T C might be collected outside the very narrow asymptotic critical region.</p><p>We estimate the critical exponent α for the specific heat [C(T ) ∝ |t| α ] as ∼ <measure type="value">0.4 </measure>using the Rushbrooke scaling relation (α + 2β + γ = 2) [50]. In the mean field theory (α = <measure type="value">0</measure>), the specific heat does not exhibit divergence at T C and there is no contribution from the magnetic critical fluctuations to the specific heat (C mag = <measure type="value">0</measure>) above T C . The α value in URhSi suggests the significant contribution to C mag (&gt; <measure type="interval">0</measure>) from the critical fluctuations above T C . This is consistent with a specific heat tail in the temperature range 0</p><p>The critical exponents in URhSi were previously reported as <quantifiedObject id="bfb7c5c6-4de7-43dd-b0cb-f00a68bec04f">β </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="interval" ptr="#bfb7c5c6-4de7-43dd-b0cb-f00a68bec04f">0.36 ± 0.02 </measure>and <quantifiedObject id="a69b48c3-5812-4e31-9562-8769563d9e98">γ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="interval" ptr="#a69b48c3-5812-4e31-9562-8769563d9e98">1.14 ± 0.06 </measure>from the analysis of the magnetization with the scaling theory in Ref. 20. The values of β and γ are larger than those in the present study. In the magnetization data reported in Refs. 20 and <measure type="list">22</measure>, the spontaneous magnetic moment occurs in magnetic fields applied along the magnetic hard a and b axes as mentioned before. The magnetization curves in the previous studies are not compatible with the simple ferromagnetic structure with the magnetic moments oriented along the c axis determined in the neutron scattering studies [21,22]. Meanwhile, the magnetization curves in this study shown in Fig. 3 (b) are consistent with the magnetic structure. In this study, the critical exponents β and γ are determined by several different methods: the modified Arrott plot, the KouvelFisher plot, and the scaling analysis. The values of β, γ, and δ satisfy the Widom scaling law (δ = <measure type="value">1</measure>+γ/β).</p><p>We discuss the unconventional critical behavior of the magnetization in URhSi, UGe 2 , URhGe, UIr, and U(Co <measure type="value">0.98 </measure>Os <measure type="value">0.02 </measure>)Al with previous theoretical approaches to critical phenomena.</p><p>(1) The universality class of the magnetic phase transition is affected by the long-range nature of the magnetic exchange interaction. The strength of the magnetic exchange interaction J(r) decreases rapidly with distance in the theoretical models with short-range (SR) interactions. The exchanged interaction can be long-ranged for the itinerant electron system. When the range of the interaction becomes longer, the critical exponents of each universality class are shifted towards those in the meanfield theory. Fischer et al. analyzed systems with the exchange interaction of a form J(r) ∼ 1/r d+σ by a renormalization group approach [51]. Here, d is the dimension of the system and σ is the range of exchange interaction. They showed the validity of such a model with long-range interactions for σ &lt; <measure type="interval">2 </measure>and derived a theoretical formula for the exponent γ = Γ{σ,d,n}. Here, n is the dimension of the order parameter and the function Γ is given in Ref. 51. Recently, we studied the critical behavior of the magnetization in URhAl around <quantifiedObject id="dc41258c-7c3a-4b50-a5ed-c60278ceb895">T C </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#dc41258c-7c3a-4b50-a5ed-c60278ceb895">26.02 K </measure>[52]. The critical exponents in URhAl were explained with the result of this renormalization group approach for the 2D Ising model coupled with long-range interactions decaying as J(r) ∼ 1/r 2+σ with <quantifiedObject id="0fc17ba2-807c-4c21-a561-e6985573e19b">σ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#0fc17ba2-807c-4c21-a561-e6985573e19b">1.44</measure>.

However, no reasonable solution of σ is found.</p><p>(2) Next, we discuss the effect of classical dipoledipole interaction on the critical phenomenon. The effect on the critical behavior of the magnetization in gadolinium (<quantifiedObject id="6547e6f3-74a9-4219-b228-471d1ef581eb">T C </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#6547e6f3-74a9-4219-b228-471d1ef581eb">292.7 K</measure>, p <quantifiedObject id="83123e86-6875-4c77-bc81-fee3f1e27845">s </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#83123e86-6875-4c77-bc81-fee3f1e27845">7.12 µ </measure>B /Gd) has been studied [53]. This scenario seems not applicable to the uranium ferromagnets since the strength of the effect depends on the square of the spontaneous magnetic moment p s [54]. The theoretical values of the critical exponents for the critical phenomena associated with the isotropic or anisotropic dipole-dipole interaction are not consistent with those in URhSi, UGe 2 , URhGe, UIr, and U(Co <measure type="value">0.98 </measure>Os <measure type="value">0.02 </measure>)Al [55,56].</p><p>(4) We discuss the critical exponents in the uranium ferromagnets from the viewpoint of the local moment magnetism. The orthorhombic TiNiSi-type crystal structure of URhSi, URhGe, and UCoGe can be regarded as the coupled zigzag chains of the nearest neighbor uranium atoms as mentioned in the introduction. UGe 2 and UIr crystalize in the orthorhombic ZrGa 2 -type (space group Cmmm) and the monoclinic PbBitype (space group P 2 1 ) structures, respectively [5,61]. The crystal structures also can be regarded as the coupled zigzag chains along the crystallographic a axis for UGe 2 and the b axis for UIr. The magnetic structures of these ferromagnets could be mapped onto the anisotropic 3D Ising model or the anisotropic next-nearest-neighbor 3D Ising (ANNNI) model. However, the critical exponents of the uranium ferromagnets are not consistent with those for the <measure type="value" ptr="#d003b12d-9285-4a36-8052-eaa8e618ee19">two </measure><quantifiedObject id="d003b12d-9285-4a36-8052-eaa8e618ee19">models </quantifiedObject>obtained by numerical calculations [62,63].</p><p>It is difficult to explain the critical exponents in the uranium ferromagnets with previous approaches to critical phenomena as discussed in points 1 − 5. Here, we introduce several interesting experimental studies on UGe 2 and suggest the relevance of the dual nature of the 5f electrons between itinerant and localized characters to the critical behaviors of the magnetization in the uranium ferromagnets [65][66][67]. The long correlation length of ξ 0 =<measure type="value">48Å </measure>with <quantifiedObject id="e1487fa6-ff96-4291-bbfc-c06298512f41">a magnetic moment </quantifiedObject>of <measure type="value" ptr="#e1487fa6-ff96-4291-bbfc-c06298512f41">0.02 µ </measure>B /U was detected in UGe 2 by the Muon spin rotation spectroscopy [65]. The value of ξ 0 is more than <measure type="interval" ptr="#cfcaca3e-ca1b-447e-a38d-9901370b6aa8">two </measure><quantifiedObject id="cfcaca3e-ca1b-447e-a38d-9901370b6aa8">times </quantifiedObject>larger than that (∼ <measure type="value">22Å</measure>) determined by the inelastic neutron scattering experiment [48]. A main contribution to the magnetic scattering intensity in the neutron scattering experiment comes from the localized component of the 5f electrons in UGe 2 since the intensity is proportional to the square of the magnetic moment. The magnetic moment on the uranium site was determined as µ <quantifiedObject id="229f278e-3788-4339-810e-901b29b8d42d">U </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#229f278e-3788-4339-810e-901b29b8d42d">1.45 − 1.46 µ B /U </measure>at <measure type="value">6 K </measure>by the polarized neutron scattering experiment [68]. The longer magnetic correlation with the smaller magnetic moment has been attributed to the itinerant component of the 5f electrons [65,66]. Very recently, Haslbeck et al. have reported the results of the ultrahigh-resolution neutron scattering experiment [67].</p><p>According to the authors, their results suggest the dual nature of spin fluctuations in UGe 2 ; local spin fluctuations described by the 3D Ising universality class and itinerant spin fluctuations. The concept of the duality of the 5f electrons has been employed in theoretical models for the superconductivity in the ferromagnetic state of UGe 2 and URhGe [69,70], and in the antiferromagnetic state of UPd 2 Al 3 [71,72]. There might be a Hund-type coupling between the itinerant and localized components of the 5f electrons. A novel critical phenomenon could appear due to the different nature of the <measure type="value">two </measure>correlations and the coupling of the <measure type="value">two </measure>components.</p><p>In Fig. 2, we show the results of the analyses on the actinide ferromagnets with the Takahashi's spin fluctuation theory [25]. The applicability of the theory to actinide 5f systems is discussed. Huxley et al. reported from the inelastic neutron scattering experiment that χ(q)Γ q remains large for q → 0 from the data of χ(q)Γ q measured for <quantifiedObject id="704c83cc-8880-4701-9fcc-f9cbbbb7a087">q </quantifiedObject>≥ <measure type="interval" ptr="#704c83cc-8880-4701-9fcc-f9cbbbb7a087">0.03</measure>Å −1 [48]. Here, Γ q is the relaxation rate for the magnetization density. This non-Landau damping of magnetic excitations suggests that the uniform magnetization density is not a conserved quantity. This fact may raise doubts about the applicability of spin fluctuation theories to the actinide 5f electrons systems. Phenomenological and microscopic theories were proposed to explain this non-zero Γ(0) focusing on the duality of the 5f electrons [73,74]. In the recent experiment by Haslbeck et al. [67], the q dependence of χ(q)Γ q was determined down to <quantifiedObject id="1b914f29-ec50-45dd-b3db-2cffc86585d5">q </quantifiedObject>∼ <measure type="value" ptr="#1b914f29-ec50-45dd-b3db-2cffc86585d5">0.02Å −1 </measure>, lower than the low limit of q (= <measure type="value">0.03Å −1 </measure>) in the previous study [48]. χ(q)Γ q is almost constant for <quantifiedObject id="c87a2169-f6ed-4ec4-96aa-bb1d7e3582df">q 0 (</quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#c87a2169-f6ed-4ec4-96aa-bb1d7e3582df">0.038Å −1 </measure>) &lt; q but it approaches to <measure type="value">zero </measure>[χ(q)Γ q → 0] for q → 0 below q 0 . This latest result in turn implies that the magnetization density is a conserved quantity. This is favorable to the application of the theory to the actinide 5f systems, though this result does not completely justify it. It is important to understand how the result reconciles with the <measure type="value">two </measure>theoretical studies. Haslbeck et al. also reported that the critical exponents [<quantifiedObject id="1df286d9-309b-4433-aad9-5e339f2de10f">β </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#1df286d9-309b-4433-aad9-5e339f2de10f">0.32</measure>(1), <quantifiedObject id="9f86e0ca-79f4-40de-8fcf-b3b8fb466ef1">γ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#9f86e0ca-79f4-40de-8fcf-b3b8fb466ef1">1.23 </measure>(3), and <quantifiedObject id="c171b2b6-3bae-4435-a000-4ac5b8fd6738">ν</quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#c171b2b6-3bae-4435-a000-4ac5b8fd6738">0.63</measure>(2)] determined by them are similar to those (<quantifiedObject id="a65cdf10-21fa-4ea7-9d94-921b59a17aee">β </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#a65cdf10-21fa-4ea7-9d94-921b59a17aee">0.325</measure>, <quantifiedObject id="b77e9d76-117e-4523-8d47-8b59885606ea">γ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#b77e9d76-117e-4523-8d47-8b59885606ea">1.241</measure>, and <quantifiedObject id="f5e5a523-fe49-4314-92db-1b3822cd2e96">ν </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#f5e5a523-fe49-4314-92db-1b3822cd2e96">0.630</measure>) in the 3D Ising model [41].

Our result is consistent with that in the previous neutron scattering study [48]. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear.</p><p>We discuss the absence of the superconductivity in URhSi and future prospects for the study of uranium ferromagnets. At first, we introduce our study on UGe 2 [75]. We measured the dc magnetization under high pressure and determined the pressure dependence of the characteristic energy of the longitudinal spin fluctuations T 0 . We have found a clear correlation between T sc and T 0 in UGe 2 . Our result suggests that the superconductiv-ity is mediated by the spin fluctuations developed at the phase boundary of FM1 and FM2 in UGe 2 . The correlation between the <measure type="value" ptr="#9eccae6c-4340-4049-b758-2fb62453f90b">two </measure><quantifiedObject id="9eccae6c-4340-4049-b758-2fb62453f90b">quantities </quantifiedObject>has been discussed in high-T c cuprate and heavy-fermion superconductors [77][78][79]. The importance of the longitudinal spin fluctuations for the p-wave superconductivity in the ferromagnetic state has been theoretically pointed out as mentioned in the Introduction [10][11][12][13]. The values of T 0 in URhGe and URhSi are similar as shown in Table II. Furthermore, this study suggests the similarity in the critical behavior of the magnetization between URhSi, URhGe, and UGe 2 [18]. Then, <measure type="value">one </measure>could expect the superconductivity in URhSi. However, it has not been observed at low temperatures down to <measure type="value">40 mK </measure>in URhSi according to Ref. 22. We discuss the absence of the superconductivity in URhSi from <measure type="value">two </measure>viewpoints.</p><p>(ii) We discuss this issue from the recent uniaxial stress experiment on URhGe [76]. The uniaxial stress σ applied along the magnetic hard b axis enhances T sc , with a merging of the low-and high-field superconducting states in URhGe [76]. The value of <quantifiedObject id="b5b244df-be85-4aba-a2b1-e20128e9c336">T </quantifiedObject>sc in URhGe increases from <measure type="value" ptr="#b5b244df-be85-4aba-a2b1-e20128e9c336">0.4 K </measure>at ambient pressure to <measure type="value">0.8 K </measure>at <quantifiedObject id="5b72118b-9c9d-45a6-bf03-7161d7485e55">σ </quantifiedObject>∼ <measure type="value" ptr="#5b72118b-9c9d-45a6-bf03-7161d7485e55">0.6 GPa </measure>applied along the b axis. Meanwhile, the ferromagnetic transition temperature T C shows only a <measure type="value">10 % </measure>decrease. There is no report for the dc magnetization under the uniaxial pressure. We speculate that the value of T 0 does not change significantly. The relation between T sc and T 0 under uniaxial stress in URhGe may be different from approximately linear relations in the high-T c cuprate and heavy-fermion superconductors [77][78][79]. It is interesting to note that the relation in FM1 of UGe 2 is expressed as T sc ∝ (T 0 ) α with <quantifiedObject id="006efd72-1bd0-455c-8704-7d8e3e72fd84">α </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="interval" ptr="#006efd72-1bd0-455c-8704-7d8e3e72fd84">2.3 ± 0.1 </measure>[75]. T sc is very sensitive to T 0 . We suggest <measure type="value">one </measure>possibility: T 0 is not a sole parameter that determines T sc in the uranium ferromagnetic superconductors.</p><p>The magnetic susceptibility χ b in a magnetic field along the magnetic hard b axis increases with increasing uniaxial stress applied along the same direction in URhGe [76]. The increase in T sc of the compound may be related to enhanced transverse magnetic fluctuations along the hard b axis as theoretically shown [82]. Mineev derived a theoretical expression of T sc in a BCS-type formula T sc = ε exp(−1/g) for a <measure type="value">two</measure>-band superconducting state in orthorhombic systems where the coupling between the <measure type="value">two </measure>components of the equal spin-triplet p-wave order parameter is taken into account [82]. The coupling constant g is expressed as follows:</p><p>The strength of the anisotropy in the magnetic susceptibilities along the magnetic hard axes increases T sc . χ b is about <measure type="value" ptr="#e2e68efa-701e-4dfa-8864-9ccf0fe50b00">5 </measure><quantifiedObject id="e2e68efa-701e-4dfa-8864-9ccf0fe50b00">times </quantifiedObject>larger than χ a in the ferromagnetic state of URhGe at ambient pressure [15]. The enhancement of T sc in the uniaxial stress applied along the b axis can be understood as the result of the increasing transverse fluctuations along the magnetic hard b axis. On the other hand, the degree of the anisotropy in the magnetic susceptibilities χ b and χ a is at most <measure type="value">two </measure>in the ferromagnetic state of URhSi as shown in Fig. 3(b). The contribution to raise T sc by this mechanism may be smaller than that in URhSi.</p><p>It is not clear which pairing mechanism (the intraband or interband one) takes a dominant role for the appearance of the superconductivity at ambient pressure in this system. It is difficult to make quantitative estimates of contributions from the <measure type="value" ptr="#e09e9f03-1ee0-4193-b3c4-83b06e770735">two </measure><quantifiedObject id="e09e9f03-1ee0-4193-b3c4-83b06e770735">mechanisms </quantifiedObject>to T sc . If the intraband pairing mediated by the longitudinal spin fluctuations is dominant, the superconductivity with the similar value of T sc to that in URhGe could appear in the high-quality sample of URhSi since the values of T 0 in URhSi and URhGe are similar. Meanwhile, if the interband pairing mediated by the transverse fluctuations plays a certain role in the superconductivity, the T sc value in URhSi could be smaller than that of URhGe even if the quality of samples is improved. This is because the strength of the transverse fluctuations in URhSi is smaller than that in URhGe as discussed above. It is necessary to grow the high-quality single-crystal sample of URhSi to settle this problem.</p><p>The critical behavior of the magnetization in uranium ferromagnet URhSi has been studied around its ferromagnetic transition temperature <quantifiedObject id="f2b7fc76-20cc-40af-bf34-73e746c2dd61">T C </quantifiedObject>∼ <measure type="value" ptr="#f2b7fc76-20cc-40af-bf34-73e746c2dd61">10 K</measure>. We have analyzed the magnetic data with a modified Arrott plot, a Kouvel-Fisher plot, the critical isotherm analysis, and the scaling analysis in order to determine the critical exponent β for the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization M s below T C , γ for the magnetic susceptibility χ, and δ for the magnetization isotherm at T C . We determine the values of the critical exponents as <quantifiedObject id="52ea8f45-531d-4c4e-9a30-29f52300ad78">β </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="interval" ptr="#52ea8f45-531d-4c4e-9a30-29f52300ad78">0.300 ± 0.002</measure>, γ ′ = <measure type="interval">1.00 ± 0.02 </measure>for T &lt; T C , <quantifiedObject id="3ee5598b-5e77-45c3-8e37-80462ed78322">γ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="interval" ptr="#3ee5598b-5e77-45c3-8e37-80462ed78322">1.03 ± 0.02 </measure>for T C &lt; T , and <quantifiedObject id="af88c7ec-4267-48e6-95bb-b47b5917da92">δ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="interval" ptr="#af88c7ec-4267-48e6-95bb-b47b5917da92">4.38 ± 0.04 </measure>from the scaling analysis and the critical isotherm analysis. The Widom scaling law <quantifiedObject id="a1459302-7804-4348-a4a0-21091dd9e4e3">δ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#a1459302-7804-4348-a4a0-21091dd9e4e3">1 </measure>+ γ/β is fulfilled with the obtained critical exponents. The ferromagnetic state in URhSi has strong uniaxial magnetic anisotropy. However, the obtained critical exponents differ from those in the 3D Ising model (<quantifiedObject id="4e6f937b-eb67-4ef4-abe5-d1f8c8faa5ae">β </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#4e6f937b-eb67-4ef4-abe5-d1f8c8faa5ae">0.325</measure>, <quantifiedObject id="e40a47d6-cb37-494a-ac34-9a070178aac3">γ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#e40a47d6-cb37-494a-ac34-9a070178aac3">1.241</measure>, and <quantifiedObject id="7bef23d3-81d4-4a7f-a425-0658b0a72d16">δ </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#7bef23d3-81d4-4a7f-a425-0658b0a72d16">4.82</measure>) with short-range exchange interactions. The values of the exponents β and γ in URhSi are similar to those in uranium ferromagnetic superconductors UGe 2 and URhGe, and uranium ferromagnets UIr and U(Co <measure type="value">0.98 </measure>Os <measure type="value">0.02 </measure>)Al. We suggest that the universality class of the ferromagnetic transition in URhSi belong to the same one for the uranium ferromagnetic superconductors and the uranium ferromagnets. In these uranium ferromagnets, the magnetic susceptibility χ shows a mean-field-theory-like behavior (χ −1 ∝ T ) around T C but the critical exponents β are close to those of 3D ferromagnets. The anomalous critical exponents in the uranium ferromagnets cannot be explained with previous theoretical studies for critical phenomena. This conventional critical behavior of the magnetization may reflect peculiar features in the ferromagnetism of the 5f electrons where the superconductivity could appear. The absence of the superconductivity in URhSi is discussed from several viewpoints. We suggest that a further progress could be expected through the improvement of the sample quality in URhSi for a deeper understanding of the ferromagnetic superconductivity in the uranium ferromagnets.</p></text>
