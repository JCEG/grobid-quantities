The present work will be helpful to bridge the gap between insulating SbCh2-based and metallic BiCh2-based systems, which show superconductivity at ambient pressure.</p><p>Since the discovery of the BiCh2-based (Ch: S, Se) layered superconductors in <measure type="value">2012</measure>, such as Bi4O4S3 and R(O,F)BiS2 (R: rare-earth element), this family of compounds has received much attention as a new class of layered superconductors [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8]. The crystal structure is composed of alternate stacks of electrically conducting BiCh2 layers and insulating (blocking) carrier reservoir layers, as schematically depicted in Fig. 1. Several types of BiCh2-based superconductors have been reported, and the <quantifiedObject id="a159c1aa-65b6-4c52-8cdd-04c64b2c41b3">highest-record Tc </quantifiedObject>of <measure type="value" ptr="#a159c1aa-65b6-4c52-8cdd-04c64b2c41b3">11 K </measure>was obtained for LaO0.5F0.5BiS2 using high-pressure technique [3,9]. In the early stages of research on a paring mechanism of BiCh2-based compounds, it was suggested that the conventional superconductivity with a fully gapped s-wave state is realized, on the basis of the first-principles calculation [10], Raman scattering [11], muon-spin spectroscopy [12], and thermal conductivity [13] experiments. However, recent first-principles calculations [14], angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy [15], and Se isotope effect [16] proposed the possibility of unconventional pairing mechanisms in BiCh2-based superconductors. Therefore, systematic characterization is still crucial to clarify the superconductivity mechanisms of these compounds.</p><p>Generally speaking, the parent phase of BiCh2-based compounds is an n-type semiconductor. These compounds show superconductivity when electron carriers are generated at the conduction bands. Because the conduction bands are mainly composed of hybridization between Bi 6p and Ch p orbitals [17,18], it is quite reasonable to expect that the understanding of the doping effects of Sb for Bi is essentially important to elucidate the superconducting mechanisms and the underlying physics in this family of compounds. Besides superconductivity, Sb doped BiCh2-based <measure type="value">4 </measure>compounds, namely SbCh2-based compounds, are also attractive from the viewpoint of the thermoelectrics and topological materials [19][20][21]. However, most of SbCh2-based compounds have been insulators so far, in spite of isovalent Sb doping on the Bi site [22][23][24][25][26]. Although the origin of insulating nature in SbCh2-based compounds has not been fully understood yet, it is probably due to insufficient orbital overlapping between Sb 5p and Ch p orbitals [27]. Indeed, insulator to metal transition was observed for Ce(O,F)SbS2 under high pressure [25].</p><p>We have reported the effects of Bi doping on high-temperature thermoelectric transport properties of SbSe2-based layered compounds NdO<measure type="value">0.8</measure>F0.2Sb1xBixSe2 (x  0.4) [26].

Electrical resistivity in the synthesized samples was systematically decreased with an increase in Bi content x. Weakly localized behavior in low temperature electrical transport was still observed for all of examined samples. Electrical transport of <quantifiedObject id="5adfd08e-d1e6-4d54-a3cd-9e2860202c6a">x </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#5adfd08e-d1e6-4d54-a3cd-9e2860202c6a">0.3 </measure>and <measure type="interval">0.7 </measure>was examined under high pressure exceeding 50 GPa using diamond anvil cell (DAC) with boron-doped diamond electrodes. It was found that both samples show superconductivity at low temperature, which is the first-ever report of superconductivity in SbCh2-based layered compounds. Further, the present study is the first report that tunes in a wide range of Bi/Sb content (<quantifiedObject id="e8b95624-ecb8-481d-aaa7-739ef55dfa79">x </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#e8b95624-ecb8-481d-aaa7-739ef55dfa79">00.8</measure>). The results enable us to bridge the gap between insulating SbCh2-based and metallic BiCh2-based systems, which shows superconductivity at ambient pressure. Because the Nd powder is reactive in air and a moist atmosphere, this process was carried out in an Ar-filled glovebox with a gas-purifier system. Then, a stoichiometric mixture of these starting materials was pressed into a pellet and heated for 15 h at <measure type="value">700ºC </measure>for <quantifiedObject id="0f885010-0613-475d-8429-efb5dac7ec88">x </quantifiedObject> <measure type="interval" ptr="#0f885010-0613-475d-8429-efb5dac7ec88">0.4 </measure>and at <measure type="value">650ºC </measure>for x  0.5 in an evacuated silica tube. Notably, amounts of impurity phases, Bi2Se3 and Nd2O2Se, was significant when the samples with x  <measure type="value">0.5 </measure>were synthesized at <measure type="value">700 </measure>o C.</p><p>The chemical compositions of the obtained samples were examined using an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX; Oxford, SwiftED3000). The phase purity and crystal structure of the samples were examined by synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (SPXRD) performed at the BL02B2 beamline of SPring-8 (proposal numbers 2018A0074 and 2018B1246). The measurements were performed at <measure type="value">297 K</measure>. The diffraction data were collected using a high-resolution 6 one-dimensional semiconductor detector (multiple MYTHEN system) [28].

The crystal structure parameters were refined by the Rietveld method using RIETAN-FP software [29]. The crystal structure was visualized using VESTA software [30].</p><p>Electrical resistivity at ambient pressure was measured using the <measure type="value">four</measure>-probe method on a GM refrigerator system. Measurements of electrical resistance under high pressure were performed using an originally designed DAC with boron-doped diamond electrodes [25,31,32] on the bottom anvil of nanopolycrystalline diamond [33], as shown in Fig. 2. The sample was placed on the boron-doped diamond electrodes in the center of the bottom anvil. The surface of the bottom anvil except for the sample space and electrical terminal were covered by the undoped diamond insulating layer. The cubic boron nitride powders with ruby manometer were used as a pressure-transmitting medium. The applied pressure was estimated by the fluorescence from ruby powders [34] and the Raman spectrum from the culet of top diamond anvil [35] by an inVia Raman Microscope (RENISHAW). The resistance was measured by a standard <measure type="value">four</measure>-probe method on a Physical Property Measurement System (Quantum Design: PPMS). representative data. Almost all the diffraction peaks can be assigned to those of the tetragonal P4/nmm space group, indicating that the obtained sample is mainly composed of NdO<measure type="value">0.8</measure>F0.2Sb1-xBixSe2-type phase. However, several peaks, attributable to impurity phases, <quantifiedObject id="50573c7e-7904-4c9c-a149-61b1fa4ea74a">Nd2O2Se </quantifiedObject>(<measure type="value" ptr="#50573c7e-7904-4c9c-a149-61b1fa4ea74a">4.1 wt%</measure>), <quantifiedObject id="1c6c9725-18c1-4e76-959e-07b519f3a9a6">NdOF </quantifiedObject>(<measure type="value" ptr="#1c6c9725-18c1-4e76-959e-07b519f3a9a6">1.9 wt%</measure>), and <quantifiedObject id="56953e4e-27a9-4ea6-80ab-d8eafc58b208">Bi2Se3 </quantifiedObject>(<measure type="value" ptr="#56953e4e-27a9-4ea6-80ab-d8eafc58b208">0.8 wt%</measure>), were also observed. At the same time, the diffraction peaks for other samples can also be assigned to those of the tetragonal P4/nmm space group, as shown in Fig. S1 [36]. Amounts of secondary phases are significant for <quantifiedObject id="89cc2bf6-2006-45fc-951b-fee9fbc3da4d">x </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#89cc2bf6-2006-45fc-951b-fee9fbc3da4d">0.8</measure>, Nd2O2Se</p><p>(<measure type="value">13.2 wt%</measure>) and <quantifiedObject id="3006d99f-38a1-432d-bbe9-77a3754fec94">Bi2Se3 </quantifiedObject>(<measure type="value" ptr="#3006d99f-38a1-432d-bbe9-77a3754fec94">12.9 wt%</measure>), suggesting solubility limit of Bi for Sb in NdO0.8F0.2Sb1-xBixSe2 is at around this composition. [37]. On the other hand, the c exhibits anomalous change at around <quantifiedObject id="7ce530a7-3f14-49f5-8332-bed0a4a1ee61">x </quantifiedObject>= <measure type="value" ptr="#7ce530a7-3f14-49f5-8332-bed0a4a1ee61">0.50</measure>.6. Although the origin of this deviation from linear relationship between c and x is not clear yet, it seems to be correlated to electrical carrier transport of the present samples, as described below. Note that c-axis length tends to correlate with amount of electron doping in the BiCh2-based systems [2][3][4][5][6][7][8].</p><p>To investigate the electrical transport under high pressure, we employed x = <measure type="value">0.3 </measure>and <measure type="interval">0.7 </measure>as the representatives of Sb-rich and Bi-rich composition, respectively. It should be noted that x = <measure type="value">0.8 </measure>is ruled out for high pressure measurements because of the existence of nonnegligible amount of <quantifiedObject id="758e434b-99b3-4e40-a6f7-78255d81fa99">Bi2Se3 secondary phase </quantifiedObject>(<measure type="value" ptr="#758e434b-99b3-4e40-a6f7-78255d81fa99">12.9 wt%</measure>), which shows superconductivity under high pressure [38,39]. Figure 6 shows the temperature dependences of electrical resistance for x = <measure type="value" ptr="#503cbf19-5643-40ca-966a-3e5cabed1955">0.3 </measure>under various pressures (a) from 12.2 GPa to 50 GPa, and (b) from 50 <quantifiedObject id="503cbf19-5643-40ca-966a-3e5cabed1955">GPa </quantifiedObject>to <measure type="interval">90 GPa</measure>.

A sudden drop of resistance was observed at <measure type="value" ptr="#fcd2987f-5b7b-424d-bf7c-bf3a222c4476">5.1 K </measure>at 50 GPa, corresponding to a superconducting transition. At 57.2 GPa, the resistance at 10 K decreases about four orders in magnitude as compared to that at 12.2 GPa, indicating the insulator to <quantifiedObject id="fcd2987f-5b7b-424d-bf7c-bf3a222c4476">metal transition </quantifiedObject>at this pressure. The resistance continued to decrease up to 90 GPa, and then, the diamond anvil was broken. It should be noted that zero <quantifiedObject id="8a6a3e3a-ae73-4d07-a2db-8abe4f3edcd6">resistivity </quantifiedObject>was not observed at low temperature, most likely due to inhomogeneity of applied pressure for polycrystalline sample, which is generally occurred with DAC systems [40]. To confirm that the observed drop of resistance was originated from the superconductivity, we measured the resistance under magnetic fields.

We deduce this is due to lattice instability in the present compounds. All of the crystal structure of the samples presented in this study is assigned to tetragonal P4/nmm space group using SPXRD measured at room temperature. However, theoretical studies show that the existence of imaginary phonons in the related compounds [10,[42][43][44][45]. These studies also reported that the total energy of the tetragonal P4/nmm is not the lowest [43,44]. Indeed, symmetry lowering to monoclinic P21/m [46][47][48] and nanoscale atomic distortion [49][50][51][52][53][54] have been experimentally observed for BiCh2-based compounds. For another layered compound, R2O2Pn with a Pn 2-net, insulating nature that originates from lattice distortion has recently been investigated [55][56][57][58][59][60].
